## Questions for Accountant

### Business Expenses
1. **Amazon purchase ($975.43):** What was purchased? Determines expense vs. asset treatment.
2. **CPA fees ($1,500):** This is clearly a business expense. Should it be reimbursed to Kurt or treated as a capital contribution?
3. **Pablochat ($240):** Paid personally -- same reimbursement question as LegalZoom.

### Personal vs. Business
4. **Accountable plan:** Should Automatique establish an accountable plan for 2025? Can this be done retroactively?
5. **Cell phone:** Can business portion of AT&T be reimbursed through the corporation?
6. **Utilities:** Can business portion of home utilities be reimbursed?
7. **Home office:** Can Automatique reimburse Kurt for home office (mortgage interest + property tax business portion)?
8. **If no accountable plan:** Are these personal expenses simply not deductible for a C-Corp shareholder?

### Tax Planning
9. **SEP-IRA:** With $73k+ net income, can we contribute to a SEP-IRA to reduce taxable income? What's the max?
10. **S-Corp election:** Should we elect S-Corp for 2025 or 2026? How does this affect NOL usage?
11. **NOL utilization:** Can the ~$23,794 cumulative NOL offset 2025 income? Any C-Corp NOL limitations?
12. **Reasonable compensation:** If S-Corp is elected, what's a reasonable salary for Kurt?
