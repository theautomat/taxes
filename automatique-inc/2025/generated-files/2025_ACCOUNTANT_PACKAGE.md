## Key Questions for Brandon

### 1. SEP-IRA / Retirement Contribution

With $73k+ net income in 2025, can we:
- Contribute to a SEP-IRA to reduce taxable income?
- What's the maximum contribution allowed?
- Can this be done retroactively for 2025 (before filing deadline)?
- If we take $0 in salary, can we still contribute to retirement?

### 2. Rami's $20,000 Contribution (2024)

Still not documented. Options:
- Stock issuance (requires valuation)
- Convertible note / SAFE
- Shareholder loan (to be repaid)
- Capital contribution

**Which is cleanest given we're now in 2025?**

### 3. S-Corp vs C-Corp Election

With profitable 2025:
- Should we elect S-Corp for 2025 or 2026?
- How does this affect using the ~$23.8k NOL carryforward?
- What's the optimal salary/distribution split?

### 4. NOL Utilization

- Can the ~$23.8k prior year losses offset 2025 income?
- Any limitations on C-Corp NOL usage?
- 2024 NOL increased from ~$1.9k to ~$7.8k after Privacy.com audit (see 2024 package for details)

### 5. Kurt's Personal Expenses

Kurt paid $624 personally for business expenses in 2025. Should this be:
- Reimbursed by the company?
- Treated as additional capital contribution?
