## Questions for Brandon

### 2025 Specific
1. **Running at a loss:** With no 2025 revenue yet, how long can we operate before needing to address?
2. **Personal expenses:** Should Kurt's 2025 personal payments ($624) be reimbursed by the company?

### Carryover from 2024
3. **Rami's $20k:** Still not documented - how to formalize?
4. **S-Corp election:** Decision needed for 2025
5. **Cumulative NOL:** ~$19k in losses - how to best utilize?
