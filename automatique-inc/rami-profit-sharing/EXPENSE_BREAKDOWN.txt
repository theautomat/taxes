EXPENSE BREAKDOWN - RAMI PROFIT SHARING PERIOD
==============================================

Period: June 14, 2024 (date of Rami's $20k contribution) through December 31, 2025


SUMMARY
-------

This document breaks down all business expenses during the profit sharing period.
The key question: which expenses should be allocated to which project?

Most expenses are general business overhead (hosting, tools, subscriptions) that
support ALL projects, not just SUO TECH or BlendFi specifically.

================================================================================
EXPENSE ALLOCATION OPTIONS
================================================================================

The challenge: Most expenses are general overhead, not project-specific.

OPTION 1: Proportional by Revenue (Current Method)
--------------------------------------------------
Allocate all expenses proportionally based on each project's share of revenue.

SUO TECH (65.3% of revenue): 65.3% of expenses
Other (34.7% of revenue): 34.7% of expenses

This assumes all expenses equally support all revenue, which may not be accurate.


OPTION 2: Direct + Overhead Allocation
--------------------------------------
1. Identify project-specific expenses (if any)
2. Remaining expenses = general overhead
3. Allocate overhead proportionally by revenue

Project-specific candidates:
- PARO MARKETPLACE ($3,449.60): Need to know which project
- Sound Strats LLC ($2,000): Need to know which project
- Specific hosting costs if apps are separated

Everything else is general overhead.


OPTION 3: Identify Project-Specific Apps/Services
-------------------------------------------------
If SUO TECH and BlendFi have separate:
- Heroku apps
- GitHub repos
- Other resources

...then those costs could be directly allocated. But this would require
detailed analysis of which services support which project.


================================================================================
QUESTIONS TO RESOLVE
================================================================================

1. PARO MARKETPLACE ($3,449.60 in July 2024)
   - What project was this contractor work for?
   - SUO TECH, BlendFi, or general?

2. Sound Strats LLC ($2,000 in Nov 2025)
   - What project was this contractor work for?

3. Hosting separation
   - Are there separate Heroku apps for SUO TECH vs BlendFi?
   - If so, can we identify which costs go to which?

4. Development tools
   - Bitrise, GitHub, Cursor, etc. - are these used for both projects?
   - Or primarily one?

5. Personal vs Business in Privacy.com
   - Many Amazon purchases, Netflix, Spotify, etc.
   - Need to confirm which are legitimate business expenses


================================================================================
RECOMMENDED APPROACH
================================================================================

Until we have clarity on project-specific expenses:

1. Use proportional allocation (Option 1) as the default
2. Document any known project-specific expenses separately
3. Adjust if/when more information is available

If you have information about which expenses were specifically for SUO TECH
work vs BlendFi work, we can update the calculation accordingly.
