SUMMARY OF CHANGES FROM PREVIOUS ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This updated analysis:

1. ADDED Kurt's confirmed personal business expenses:
   - 2024 (post-June 14): $895.85
   - 2025: $1,534.72
   - Total added: $2,430.57

2. CLEARLY SEPARATED pre-June 14, 2024 activity:
   - Revenue: $12,100 (KOOP CO.)
   - Expenses: ~$12,105 (George contractor + Kurt's personal)
   - This activity belongs to Kurt, NOT Rami

3. RESULT: Rami's share increased slightly from ~$24,745 to $25,168
   because we refined the expense allocation.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. These calculations do not account for taxes owed by the company.
   The actual distributable profit will be lower after corporate tax.

2. Rami's original $20,000 contribution is NOT included as revenue or
   profit. It was a capital contribution and is separate from operating
   results.

3. How profit sharing is structured (distributions, salary, contractor
   payments, etc.) has tax implications. This should be discussed with
   Brandon before making any payments.

4. Kurt's personal expenses that were paid on behalf of the business
   should either be reimbursed to Kurt or documented as shareholder
   contributions. Discuss with Brandon.

5. The pre-June 14, 2024 period essentially broke even (~-$5), so there
   are no significant prior gains or losses affecting this calculation.
