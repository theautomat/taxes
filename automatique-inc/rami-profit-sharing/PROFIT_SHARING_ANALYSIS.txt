NOTES
-----

1. These calculations do not account for taxes owed by the company.
   The actual distributable profit will be lower after corporate tax.

2. The ~$2,700 Privacy.com estimate for post-June-14 2024 is a rough
   proration. Exact amounts can be calculated from the full Privacy.com
   source data if needed.

3. Rami's original $20,000 contribution is NOT included as revenue or
   profit. It was a capital contribution and is separate from operating
   results.

4. How profit sharing is structured (distributions, salary, contractor
   payments, etc.) has tax implications. This should be discussed with
   Brandon before making any payments.

5. "Auto Routing" is a Mercury payment feature name, not the client name.
   These payments are confirmed to be from SUO TECH/Bloom based on client
   knowledge (Mercury does not capture the originating company name for
   Auto Routing payments).

6. BlendFi payments appear directly labeled as "1/BLENDFI INC" in Mercury
   starting August 2025, totaling $30,000.
