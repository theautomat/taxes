PROFIT CALCULATION
------------------

  Total Revenue:                      $88,080.24
  Total Expenses:                    ~$22,702.20
                                      ----------
  TOTAL PROFIT:                      ~$65,378.04


SCENARIO A: FLAT 10%
---------------------

  Rami's share: 10% x ~$65,378 = ~$6,537.80


SCENARIO B: FLAT 50%
---------------------

  Rami's share: 50% x ~$65,378 = ~$32,689.02


SCENARIO C: HYBRID (BlendFi/SUO TECH at 50%, other at 10%)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Expenses allocated proportionally by revenue share:

  BlendFi + SUO TECH revenue:         $87,500.00   (99.3% of total)
  Other revenue:                          $580.24    (0.7% of total)

  BlendFi + SUO TECH expenses (99.3%): ~$22,543.10
  Other expenses (0.7%):                   ~$159.10

  BlendFi + SUO TECH profit:          ~$64,956.90
  Other profit:                           ~$421.14

  Rami's share:
    50% of BlendFi/SUO TECH profit:   ~$32,478.45
    10% of other profit:                   ~$42.11
                                      ----------
    TOTAL:                            ~$32,520.56

  Note: Because BlendFi/SUO TECH represent 99.3% of revenue, the
  hybrid scenario is nearly identical to the flat 50% scenario.


SUMMARY
-------

  Scenario                    Rami's Share
  --------------------------  ------------
  A. Flat 10%                   ~$6,538
  B. Flat 50%                  ~$32,689
  C. Hybrid (50%/10%)         ~$32,521


NOTES
-----

1. These calculations do not account for taxes owed by the company.
   The actual distributable profit will be lower after corporate tax.

2. The ~$2,700 Privacy.com estimate for post-June-14 2024 is a rough
   proration. Exact amounts can be calculated from the full Privacy.com
   source data if needed.

3. Rami's original $20,000 contribution is NOT included as revenue or
   profit. It was a capital contribution and is separate from operating
   results.

4. How profit sharing is structured (distributions, salary, contractor
   payments, etc.) has tax implications. This should be discussed with
   Brandon before making any payments.

5. The PARO Marketplace charge ($3,449.60) inflates 2024 expenses. If
   that is excluded as a non-recurring cost, total profit increases to
   ~$68,828 and Rami's shares would be:
     A. Flat 10%:       ~$6,883
     B. Flat 50%:      ~$34,414
     C. Hybrid 50/10%: ~$34,237
