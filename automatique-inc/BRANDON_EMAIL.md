## Questions for You

### 1. SEP-IRA / Retirement Contribution
With $73k profit in 2025, can we contribute to a SEP-IRA to reduce taxable income? Can this be done retroactively before filing? What's the max contribution?

### 2. S-Corp vs C-Corp
Should we elect S-Corp status? For which year - 2025 or 2026? How does this affect the NOL carryforward?

### 3. Rami's $20,000 Contribution
Rami wired $20k to the company in June 2024. It's not documented. What's the cleanest way to formalize this now? Options:
- Stock issuance
- Convertible note / SAFE
- Shareholder loan
- Capital contribution

### 4. NOL Utilization
Can the ~$23.8k in prior year losses offset 2025 income? Any limitations under C-Corp rules?

### 5. Personally-Paid Business Expenses
Kurt paid business expenses personally across all three years:
- **2023:** ~$16k (all expenses, pre-Mercury)
- **2024:** ~$6,546 via Privacy.com (LegalZoom, Google Workspace, Heroku, Bitrise, Midjourney, GoDaddy, GitHub, ChatGPT, etc.)
- **2025:** $624 (LegalZoom, Pablochat) + ~$1,500 CPA fees

How should these be treated? Shareholder loan? Capital contribution? Can the company reimburse Kurt?

### 6. Accountable Plan
Should Automatique establish an accountable plan to reimburse Kurt for home office, cell phone, internet, and utilities? Can this be done retroactively for 2024/2025?

### 7. Potential Additional Deductions (2025)
The following personal expenses could be partially business-deductible if an accountable plan is established:
- Cell phone (AT&T): $2,236/yr (50-60% business)
- Utilities: ~$4,885/yr (business % TBD)
- CPA/Accounting (SRDS CPAs): ~$1,500
- Internet (Spectrum): ~$2,460/yr (**not found in bank records** - likely on credit card)
