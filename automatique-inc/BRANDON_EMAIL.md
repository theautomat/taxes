## Questions for You

### 1. SEP-IRA / Retirement Contribution
With $73k profit in 2025, can we contribute to a SEP-IRA to reduce taxable income? Can this be done retroactively before filing? What's the max contribution?

### 2. S-Corp vs C-Corp
Should we elect S-Corp status? For which year - 2025 or 2026? How does this affect the NOL carryforward?

### 3. Rami's $20,000 Contribution
Rami wired $20k to the company in June 2024. It's not documented. What's the cleanest way to formalize this now? Options:
- Stock issuance
- Convertible note / SAFE
- Shareholder loan
- Capital contribution

### 4. NOL Utilization
Can the $17.9k in prior year losses offset 2025 income? Any limitations?

### 5. Personal Expenses
Kurt paid ~$17k of business expenses personally (2023-2025). Should this be:
- Reimbursed by the company?
- Treated as capital contribution?
