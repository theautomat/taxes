NOTES FOR ACCOUNTANT
--------------------
1. Kurt's Privacy.com 2024 expenses marked "already in records" ($660.22)
   may already be captured in company books - please verify to avoid
   double-counting

2. All Amazon purchases were reviewed item-by-item; only confirmed
   business equipment is included

3. Mercury expenses are complete from corporate bank statements

4. The $975.43 Amazon charge on Mercury (Oct 2025) may have some overlap
   with Kurt's personal Amazon purchases - please verify

5. 2023 EXPENSES ($16,052.27): All paid from Kurt's personal accounts:
   - $500 incorporation via Stripe Atlas
   - $10,000 contractor payments via Zelle to Popstand
   - $5,490.79 software/services via Privacy.com
   - $61.48 Amazon office equipment

6. PRE-INCORPORATION ITEMS: Kurt has $114.95 in Amazon purchases from before
   May 7, 2023 that were used for Automatique business. See 2023 expense file
   for details - need Brandon's guidance on whether these can be deducted.

QUESTION FOR BRANDON:
---------------------
Can Automatique Inc reimburse Kurt for business expenses paid personally?
We don't know if this is allowed or what the proper procedure would be.
Please advise on:
- Can the company reimburse Kurt for 2023, 2024, and 2025 personal expenses?
- What documentation is needed?
- Are there tax implications for the reimbursement?
