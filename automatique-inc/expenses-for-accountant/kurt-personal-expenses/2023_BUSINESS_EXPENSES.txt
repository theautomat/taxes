NOTE FOR ACCOUNTANT (Brandon):
------------------------------
There are additional 2023 business expenses paid by Kurt personally via
Privacy.com (software subscriptions, hosting, AI tools, domains, etc.)
totaling approximately $5,500. These are documented separately in:
  2023/generated-files/2023_EXPENSES_SUMMARY.md

QUESTION: Can Automatique Inc reimburse Kurt for these personal expenses
paid on behalf of the business? We don't know if this is allowed or what
the proper procedure would be. Please advise.
