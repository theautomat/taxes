NOL CARRYFORWARD APPLICATION
================================================================================

  Year   Revenue    Expenses    Net
  ----   --------   ---------   -----------------
  2023   $0         $16,816     ($16,816) NOL
  2024   $12,100    $20,821     ($8,721) NOL
  Cumulative NOL:                ($25,537)
  2025   $88,080    $15,740     $72,340 gross income

C-CORP NOL APPLICATION (CURRENT STRUCTURE)
  2025 Gross Income:                     $72,340.02
  Prior Year NOL (80% limit):           ($25,537.00)
    (min of $25,537 and $72,340 x 80%)
  Estimated Taxable Income:              $46,803.02
  Estimated Federal Tax (21%):            $9,828.63

IF S-CORP WERE ELECTED
  Income would pass through to Kurt's personal return
  Subject to Kurt's marginal rate (~45.3% combined federal + CA)
  But NOLs would also have passed through in prior years
  Accountant should model both scenarios
