================================================================================
NOTES FOR ACCOUNTANT
================================================================================

1. DOUBLE-COUNTING WARNING: Kurt's 2024 Privacy.com expenses marked "already
   in records" ($660.22) may already be in company books. Please verify.

2. PRE-INCORPORATION ITEMS: Kurt has $114.95 in Amazon purchases from before
   May 7, 2023 that were used for Automatique business:
   - Seagate 1TB External Hard Drive ($49.99)
   - Learn Three.js Book ($44.99)
   - Screen Cleaner Spray ($19.97)
   Please advise if these can be deducted.

3. AMAZON ON MERCURY: The $975.43 Amazon charge on Mercury (Oct 2025) is a
   Windows laptop purchased for testing Windows applications the company builds.

4. ALL EXPENSES VERIFIED: Every Amazon purchase was reviewed item-by-item.
   Only confirmed business items are included. No personal purchases.


================================================================================
QUESTIONS FOR BRANDON
================================================================================

1. REIMBURSEMENT PROCEDURE: Can Automatique Inc reimburse Kurt for business
   expenses paid personally ($25,813.83 across 2023-2025)? What documentation
   is needed? What are the tax implications?

2. PAYABLES: You mentioned recording a payable in each year with IRS AFR
   interest when reimbursed. Can you provide guidance on the process?

3. PRE-INCORPORATION: Can the $114.95 in pre-incorporation Amazon purchases
   be deducted as startup costs?

4. 1099/W-8BEN REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTRACTORS:
   - George (international contractor, paid $8,105.31 via wire in 2024):
     Do we need a W-8BEN on file? Was there a filing obligation?
   - Pablo (paid $10,000 via Zelle to Popstand in 2023):
     Since payments went through Popstand (another company), does
     Automatique need to file a 1099, or does Popstand handle that?
   - Sound Strats LLC (paid $2,000 in 2025):
     Do we need a 1099-NEC for this payment?
   - What are the penalties if these weren't filed on time, and can
     they be filed late?
