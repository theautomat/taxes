BETWEEN:

BORROWER: Automatique Inc, a Delaware C-Corporation
Represented by: Kurt Braget, Chief Executive Officer ("Company" or "Borrower")

RECITALS
================================================================================

WHEREAS, on or about June 14, 2024, the Lender provided funds to the Borrower
in the amount of Twenty Thousand Dollars ($20,000.00 USD) as a loan for the
purpose of operating capital to support business operations; and

WHEREAS, at the time of funding, the Parties entered into an oral agreement
whereby the Borrower agreed to repay the full amount of the loan to the Lender,
and the Parties at all times intended and understood the transfer of funds to
constitute a bona fide loan and not a gift, capital contribution, or equity
investment; and

WHEREAS, the delay in reducing the oral agreement to writing was due to the
Parties' focus on business operations and does not reflect any uncertainty
regarding the nature of the transaction as a bona fide loan; and

WHEREAS, the Parties now wish to reduce their oral agreement to writing,
memorialize the terms of this loan, and establish a formal repayment schedule;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements set
forth herein, the Parties agree as follows:

================================================================================
ARTICLE 3: INTEREST
================================================================================

3.1 INTEREST RATE
This loan shall bear simple interest at a rate of Five and 12/100 Percent
(5.12%) per annum, which is equal to the short-term Applicable Federal Rate
("AFR") as published by the Internal Revenue Service for the month of June 2024
(the month in which the loan was funded) (see IRS Revenue Ruling 2024-12).
Interest shall accrue on the outstanding principal balance from the Date of
Funding (June 14, 2024) until the principal is repaid in full.

Interest accrued but unpaid during the period from June 14, 2024 through
January 30, 2026 ("Accrued Gap Interest") totals approximately $1,672.00 and
is included in the repayment schedule set forth in Section 2.1.

3.2 INTEREST CALCULATION
Interest shall accrue on the outstanding principal balance using simple interest.
Interest shall be calculated as follows:

  Daily Interest = (Outstanding Principal Balance) x (5.12% / 365)

Unpaid interest shall not itself bear interest. No compounding shall apply.

3.3 INTEREST PAYMENT
Accrued interest shall be due and payable monthly along with each scheduled
principal payment set forth in Section 2.1. Each monthly payment shall consist
of the principal installment of $2,500.00, plus accrued repayment-period
interest for that period, plus a pro rata share of the Accrued Gap Interest.

3.4 DEFAULT INTEREST RATE
Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default as defined in Section 4.1, the
interest rate on any outstanding balance shall increase to Ten Percent (10%)
per annum, effective from the date of default until the default is cured or
the loan is repaid in full.


================================================================================
ARTICLE 4: DEFAULT
================================================================================

4.1 EVENTS OF DEFAULT
The following shall constitute Events of Default under this Agreement:

(a) Failure to make any scheduled payment within thirty (30) days of its
    due date;

(b) The Borrower files for bankruptcy, becomes insolvent, or makes an
    assignment for the benefit of creditors;

(c) The Borrower ceases business operations;

(d) Any other material breach of this Agreement.

4.2 REMEDIES UPON DEFAULT
Upon an Event of Default, the Lender may, at their option:

(a) Declare the entire unpaid principal balance, plus any accrued interest,
    immediately due and payable;

(b) Pursue any legal remedies available under applicable law.

4.3 CURE PERIOD
For any Event of Default under Section 4.1(d), the Borrower shall have thirty
(30) days from written notice of default to cure the breach before the Lender
may exercise remedies under Section 4.2. Payment defaults under Section 4.1(a)
have a single thirty (30) day grace period built into the definition and are
not subject to an additional cure period.
