## Important Notes for Accountant

### 1. Rami's $20,000 Contribution

Rami Elhaj wired $20,000 to the company on June 14, 2024. This is **NOT documented** as equity or a formal agreement.

**Questions:**
- Should this be equity (stock issuance)?
- A convertible note / SAFE?
- A loan to be repaid?
- A capital contribution?

### 2. PARO MARKETPLACE Charge

$3,449.60 charged on July 9, 2024 by PARO MARKETPLACE (accounting firm). This was a bad experience - they weren't a good fit but the charge couldn't be cancelled.

**Treatment:** Professional Services - Accounting

### 3. Personal Payment of Business Expenses

Kurt paid $660.22 of AUTOMATIQUE expenses from personal accounts (via Privacy.com virtual cards):
- LegalZoom registered agent: $372.00
- Google Workspace: $288.22

**Question:** Should this be treated as:
- Shareholder loan to the company?
- Capital contribution by Kurt?

### 4. NOL Carryforward

Company has losses:
- 2023: ~$16,000 loss
- 2024: ~$1,918 loss
- **Cumulative NOL: ~$17,918**

How do these carry forward under C-Corp rules? Any implications if we elect S-Corp?

### Compliance
