5. **Is Rami currently "All In" or "Flexible"?** (Affects profit share %)
6. **Has any profit share been paid yet?**

## Calculation Framework (Once Deal is Clarified)

```
MONTHLY CALCULATION:

1. Total Revenue (from Mercury deposits, excluding Rami's capital)
2. Minus: Bloom Revenue (SUO TECH INC payments)
3. = Non-Bloom Revenue

4. Total Expenses (from Mercury withdrawals)
5. Allocate expenses proportionally or by project

RAMI'S SHARE:
- Bloom: 50% × (Bloom Revenue - Bloom Expenses)
- Other: [X]% × (Non-Bloom Revenue - Non-Bloom Expenses)
  where X = 5%, 7.5%, 15%, 18%, or 20% depending on deal tier

PAYMENT METHOD (TBD with accountant):
- W-2 wages (requires payroll, subject to employment taxes)
- 1099 contractor (simpler, he pays self-employment tax)
- K-1 distribution (if S-Corp, after reasonable salary)
```
