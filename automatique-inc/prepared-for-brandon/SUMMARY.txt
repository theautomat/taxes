QUESTIONS FOR BRANDON
---------------------

Tax Structure & Planning

  1. S-Corp Election
     Should we elect S-Corp? For which year (2025 or 2026)? How does this
     affect the ~$23.8k NOL carryforward and what would the optimal
     salary/distribution split look like?

  2. NOL Utilization
     Can the ~$23,794 cumulative NOL (2023 + 2024) offset 2025 income?
     Any C-Corp limitations?

  3. SEP-IRA / Retirement
     With $73k profit in 2025, can we contribute to a SEP-IRA before
     filing to reduce taxable income? Does Kurt need to take a salary
     first?

  4. Salaries / Compensation
     No salaries have been paid to anyone in 2023, 2024, or 2025. Kurt
     and Rami have both been working in the business. What's the best way
     to start paying compensation? Should we set up payroll going forward,
     or is there a way to retroactively pay salaries for prior years?
     This is especially relevant if we elect S-Corp, since the IRS
     requires reasonable compensation before distributions.

Open Items

  5. Rami's $20,000 Contribution
     $20,000 wired to Mercury in June 2024. Not documented. Should this
     be a capital contribution, shareholder loan, or something else?

  6. Personally-Paid Business Expenses
     Kurt paid ~$23k of business expenses from personal accounts across
     2023-2025. Should this be treated as shareholder loan or capital
     contribution? Can the company reimburse Kurt?

  7. Accountable Plan
     Should Automatique establish an accountable plan so Kurt can be
     reimbursed for home office, cell phone, and similar expenses going
     forward?

Compliance

  8. Filing Status
     What are the deadlines and any late-filing penalties for 2023 and
     2024? What's the 2025 deadline?

  9. 1099s
     - 2023: $10k to Popstand (domestic, Zelle)
     - 2024: $8.1k to George (international, wire)
     - 2025: $2k to Sound Strats LLC

 10. State Compliance
     Delaware franchise tax owed for 2023-2025? Any California foreign
     corp requirements?
