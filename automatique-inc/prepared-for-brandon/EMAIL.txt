Subject: Automatique Inc - Tax Filing Package (2023-2025)

Hi Brandon,

Attached is the tax filing package for Automatique, Inc. (EIN 38-4207516)
covering 2023, 2024, and 2025.

Quick overview:
- C-Corp incorporated in Delaware, May 2023
- 2023: $0 revenue, $16k loss (startup year)
- 2024: $12k revenue, ~$8k loss (first clients)
- 2025: $88k revenue, $73k profit (strong year)
- Cumulative NOL from 2023+2024: ~$23,794

What's in the package:
- SUMMARY.txt -- Start here. High-level overview with all my questions.
- 2023/, 2024/, 2025/ -- Detailed packages for each year.

Biggest questions:
1. Can we use the ~$24k NOL to offset 2025 income?
2. Should we elect S-Corp (and for which year)?
3. Can we set up a SEP-IRA to reduce 2025 taxable income?
4. How do we formalize Rami's $20k contribution from 2024?

Everything is detailed in the SUMMARY.txt. Let me know if you need
anything else.

Thanks,
Kurt
