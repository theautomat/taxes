## Questions for Brandon

### Tax Structure

**1. S-Corp vs C-Corp Election**
Should we elect S-Corp status? For which year? How does this affect:
- Using the ~$23.8k cumulative NOL?
- Kurt's reasonable salary amount?
- Optimal salary/distribution split for 2025's $73k profit?

**2. Retroactive S-Corp**
Can we retroactively elect S-Corp for 2023 to pass through the $16k loss to Kurt's personal return?

### NOL & Tax Planning

**3. NOL Utilization**
- Cumulative NOL: ~$23,794 (2023: $15,991 + 2024: ~$7,803)
- Can this offset 2025 income under C-Corp rules?
- Any limitations?

**4. SEP-IRA / Retirement**
With $73k profit in 2025:
- Can we contribute to a SEP-IRA to reduce taxable income?
- Max contribution amount?
- Can this be done retroactively before filing?
- Does it require Kurt to take a salary?

### Rami's $20,000

**5. Rami Elhaj Contribution**
$20,000 wired to Mercury in June 2024. Not documented. What's the cleanest option now?
- Stock issuance (requires valuation)
- Convertible note / SAFE
- Shareholder loan
- Capital contribution (no equity)

### Personal Expenses

**6. Personally-Paid Business Expenses**
Kurt paid ~$23k of business expenses from personal accounts across 2023-2025. Treatment options:
- Shareholder loan to the company?
- Capital contribution?
- Can the company reimburse Kurt?

**7. Accountable Plan**
Should Automatique establish an accountable plan to reimburse Kurt for:
- Home office (mortgage interest + property tax, business %)
- Cell phone (AT&T ~$2,236/yr, 50-60% business)
- Internet (Spectrum ~$2,460/yr -- not found in bank records, likely on credit card)
- Utilities (~$4,885/yr, business % TBD)
Can this be done retroactively for 2024/2025?

**8. CPA Fees**
Kurt is paying SRDS CPAs ~$500/mo starting Oct 2025 (~$1,500 for 2025). This is clearly a business expense. How should it be treated?

### Compliance

**9. Delaware Franchise Tax**
What's owed for 2023, 2024, 2025? Any penalties for late payment?

**10. California Foreign Corp**
Any CA compliance requirements for a Delaware corp operating in CA?

**11. 1099s**
- 2023: $10k to Popstand (domestic, via Zelle) -- 1099 needed?
- 2024: $8.1k to George (international, via wire) -- 1099 needed?
- 2025: $2k to Sound Strats LLC -- 1099 needed?

**12. Filing Deadlines & Penalties**
- 2023 return: What's owed? Late filing penalties?
- 2024 return: What's owed? Late filing penalties?
- 2025 return: What's the deadline?
