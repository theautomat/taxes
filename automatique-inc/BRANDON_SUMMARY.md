## Questions for Brandon

### 1. S-Corp Election (Primary Question)

**Background:** We're considering electing S-Corp status to pass through losses to Kurt's personal return.

**Questions:**
1. **Is S-Corp election a one-time filing?**
   - My understanding: File Form 2553 once, then company stays S-Corp going forward (file 1120-S each year) until revoked or ineligible. Is this correct?

2. **Can we retroactively elect S-Corp for 2023?**
   - Company incorporated May 7, 2023
   - Normal deadline was March 15, 2023 (before we existed)
   - Is late election relief (Rev. Proc. 2013-30) available?
   - We're within 3 years of the original deadline

3. **If S-Corp elected retroactively:**
   - 2023 ~$16k loss would pass through to Kurt's personal return
   - At ~45% marginal rate, potential tax savings of ~$7,200
   - Is this worth pursuing vs. just keeping C-Corp NOL carry-forward?

4. **What happens to C-Corp NOLs if we convert to S-Corp?**
   - Are they lost?
   - Is there a built-in gains tax issue?

### 2. Treatment of Founder-Paid Expenses

Kurt paid ~$16k of 2023 company expenses from personal accounts.

**Question:** Should this be treated as:
- **Shareholder loan** to the company (to be repaid later)? OR
- **Capital contribution** (increases basis in stock)?

What's the proper documentation needed?

### 3. Rami's $20,000 Contribution

Rami wired $20,000 to the company in June 2024. This is NOT documented.

**Questions:**
1. How should we formalize this retroactively?
   - Additional stock issuance?
   - Convertible note?
   - Simple loan to be repaid?
2. Does he need to be on payroll if he's a shareholder?
3. What's the cleanest approach given we're already in 2025?

### 4. Reasonable Salary Requirement (if S-Corp)

If we elect S-Corp, owner-employees must receive "reasonable salary."

**Questions:**
1. Company has been operating at a loss - how do we handle salary requirement with no cash?
2. Can it be deferred compensation?
3. What's considered "reasonable" for a software startup founder?

### 5. Contractor Reporting

Paid ~$10,000 to contractors in 2023 (via Popstand intermediary) and ~$10,600 in 2024 (George - international).

**Questions:**
1. Is 1099 required for 2023 payments that went through Popstand?
2. Is 1099 required for international contractor (George)?
3. What info do we need from George for proper reporting?

### 6. State Compliance

**Delaware:**
- What's owed for Delaware Franchise Tax (2023, 2024)?
- Any penalties for late payment?

**California:**
- Does Automatique need to register as a foreign corporation in CA?
- What filings are needed?
- Is California $800 minimum franchise tax applicable?

### 7. Filing Deadlines & Penalties

**Questions:**
1. What's the deadline for 2023 corporate return? (We're late)
2. What penalties should we expect?
3. Should we file extension for 2024?

## Recommendation Request

Given our situation (3 years of losses, single owner, no plans for VC funding currently), what do you recommend:

**Option A: Stay C-Corp**
- Keep NOLs at corporate level
- Offset future profits (limited to 80%)
- Double taxation when profitable

**Option B: Elect S-Corp for 2025 only**
- Clean start going forward
- Pass-through taxation
- C-Corp NOLs may be complicated

**Option C: Retroactive S-Corp election (2023)**
- Pass through 2023 loss to Kurt (~$7,200 tax savings)
- Consistent treatment all years
- More complex to implement

Which option makes the most sense? What's the cost/benefit analysis?
