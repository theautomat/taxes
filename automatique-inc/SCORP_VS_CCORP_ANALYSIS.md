## Analysis for Each Tax Year

### 2023: Loss Year ($15,991 NOL)

**C-Corp Treatment:**
- Loss stays in the corporation
- Can carry forward indefinitely
- Will offset future profits (up to 80%)
- No tax benefit to Kurt personally in 2023

**S-Corp Treatment (if elected):**
- Loss would pass through to Kurt's personal return
- Kurt could deduct ~$16k against his other 2023 income
- At Kurt's marginal rate (~45%), this could save **~$7,200 in taxes**

**2023 Verdict:** S-Corp potentially beneficial if:
1. Late election relief is available
2. Kurt has sufficient basis in the company
3. The loss isn't limited by passive activity rules

### 2024: Loss Year (~$1,400 NOL)

**C-Corp Treatment:**
- Small loss adds to cumulative NOL
- Continues to carry forward

**S-Corp Treatment:**
- Small loss passes through
- Minor tax benefit (~$600 at 45% rate)

**2024 Verdict:** Minimal difference due to small loss.

### 2025 and Beyond: When Company Becomes Profitable

**C-Corp Treatment:**
- Corporate profits taxed at 21%
- Distributions to shareholders taxed as qualified dividends (~20% + 3.8% NIIT)
- Effective tax on distributed profits: ~40%+
- BUT: Can use prior NOLs to offset profits

**S-Corp Treatment:**
- Profits pass through at shareholder's marginal rate (~45%)
- BUT: Can split income between "reasonable salary" (subject to payroll tax) and distributions (no payroll tax)
- Potential payroll tax savings on distribution portion

**Future Verdict:** Depends on profit level and compensation strategy.

## S-Corp Election: Practical Considerations

### Requirements to Elect S-Corp
1. All shareholders must be US citizens/residents
2. Maximum 100 shareholders
3. Only one class of stock
4. Must file Form 2553

**Automatique Status:** Meets all requirements ✓

### Election Deadlines

| For Tax Year | Normal Deadline | Late Relief Available? |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| 2023 | March 15, 2023 | Possibly, if filing within 3 years |
| 2024 | March 15, 2024 | Possibly |
| 2025 | March 15, 2025 | **On time!** |

**Key:** IRS allows late S-Corp elections if:
- The entity intended to be an S-Corp
- Had reasonable cause for missing deadline
- Is filing within the statute of limitations

### Reasonable Salary Requirement

If S-Corp is elected, Kurt (and Rami if compensated) must receive "reasonable salary" for services performed.

**What's Reasonable?**
- Based on comparable positions in the industry
- For a tech startup founder/developer: $80,000 - $150,000+ depending on market
- IRS scrutinizes S-Corps that pay minimal salaries to avoid payroll taxes

**Risk:** If company is unprofitable, paying salaries increases losses but also proves compensation is "reasonable" when profits come.

## Scenarios: What Should Automatique Do?

### Scenario A: Stay C-Corp

**Pros:**
- No action required
- NOLs preserved to offset future profits
- More flexibility for future fundraising (VCs prefer C-Corps)
- Can have multiple stock classes if needed for investors

**Cons:**
- 2023 loss doesn't benefit Kurt personally
- Double taxation when profits are distributed
- NOL only offsets 80% of future profits

**Best if:** Company expects to raise venture capital or has complex equity needs.

### Scenario B: Elect S-Corp for 2025 Only

**Pros:**
- Clean start for 2025
- No complications with prior years
- Pass-through taxation going forward

**Cons:**
- C-Corp NOLs from 2023-2024 may be lost or complicated
- Reasonable salary requirement kicks in immediately

**Best if:** Company expects significant profits in 2025+ and wants simpler taxation.

### Scenario C: Retroactive S-Corp Election (2023 or 2024)

**Pros:**
- 2023 loss could benefit Kurt personally (~$7,200 tax savings)
- Consistent tax treatment across all years

**Cons:**
- May require amended returns
- IRS must grant late election relief
- More complex to implement

**Best if:** Accountant confirms late election is feasible and beneficial.

## Action Items

1. [ ] Discuss with Brandon: Is retroactive S-Corp election for 2023 feasible?
2. [ ] Calculate: Tax savings from 2023 loss pass-through vs. C-Corp NOL carry-forward
3. [ ] Decide: S-Corp or C-Corp for 2025 (deadline March 15, 2025)
4. [ ] If S-Corp: Determine reasonable salary for Kurt
5. [ ] Document: Rami's status (if he should be receiving salary/distributions)

---

## Notes

- This analysis assumes Kurt is in a high marginal tax bracket (~45% combined federal + CA)
- Rami's $20k contribution is currently undocumented - may affect ownership/distribution analysis
- Company's future trajectory (profitable vs. continued losses) will impact optimal choice
