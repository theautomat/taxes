## Net Operating Loss Analysis

### What This Means

The company had a **Net Operating Loss (NOL) of $15,990.79** in its first partial year of operation.

### For C-Corp (Current Structure):
- NOL can be carried forward indefinitely to offset future profits
- Limited to 80% of taxable income in future years
- No current tax liability (loss year)

### For S-Corp (If Elected):
- Loss would pass through to shareholders' personal returns
- Kurt Braget (100% shareholder in 2023) could potentially deduct loss
- Subject to basis, at-risk, and passive activity limitations

### Key Consideration:
Since there was no revenue in 2023, the entire loss represents startup/development costs. This is typical for a tech startup in its first year.

## Payment Source Note

**IMPORTANT:** All 2023 expenses were paid from Kurt Braget's personal accounts:
- Wells Fargo checking (via debit card and Zelle)
- Privacy.com virtual cards

This creates a receivable from the company to Kurt, which should be documented as:
1. **Shareholder Loan** - Kurt loaned money to the company (to be repaid), OR
2. **Capital Contribution** - Kurt contributed capital (increases basis in stock)

**Action Item:** Accountant should advise on proper treatment.
