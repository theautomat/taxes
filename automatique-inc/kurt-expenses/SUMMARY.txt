IMPACT ON RAMI'S PROFIT SHARE
-----------------------------

Kurt's confirmed expenses will be added to company costs:
- Total expenses for the profit-sharing period will increase by ~$7,380
- This will reduce the profit
- Rami's share will be slightly lower

Current profit sharing estimate (before Kurt's expenses):
  Rami's share: ~$24,745

After adding Kurt's $7,380 in confirmed expenses, Rami's share will decrease.
(Additional reduction if Amazon contains business equipment)
