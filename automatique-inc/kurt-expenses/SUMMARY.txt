  Additional likely business:       $0.00
  POTENTIAL 2025 TOTAL:          $384.00

COMBINED 2024 + 2025:          ~$6,930.22


WORKFLOW
--------

1. Kurt reviews PRIVACY_COM_REVIEW.txt files in each year folder
2. Kurt marks each expense as [Y]es, [N]o, or [?]
3. Claude updates the extracted files with confirmed expenses
4. Final totals calculated
5. Package sent to Brandon


IMPACT ON RAMI'S PROFIT SHARE
-----------------------------

Once Kurt's expenses are confirmed and added:
- Total expenses for the profit-sharing period will increase
- This will reduce the profit
- Rami's share will be slightly lower

Current profit sharing estimate (before expense review):
  Rami's share: ~$24,745

This will decrease once Kurt's ~$6,930 in additional expenses are added.
