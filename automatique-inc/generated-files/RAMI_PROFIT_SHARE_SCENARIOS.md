## Scenario Calculator

### Example: $10,000 Bloom Payment

| Scenario | Allocated Expenses | Net Profit | Rami's Share (50%) |
|----------|-------------------|------------|-------------------|
| Low expenses | $1,000 | $9,000 | **$4,500** |
| Medium expenses | $2,500 | $7,500 | **$3,750** |
| High expenses | $5,000 | $5,000 | **$2,500** |

### Example: $10,000 Non-Bloom Revenue (at different profit share rates)

| Base % | Allocated Expenses | Net Profit | Rami's Share |
|--------|-------------------|------------|--------------|
| 10% | $2,500 | $7,500 | **$750** |
| 15% | $2,500 | $7,500 | **$1,125** |
| 20% | $2,500 | $7,500 | **$1,500** |

## Expense Allocation Method (TBD)

Options:
1. **Pro-rata by revenue** - Allocate expenses proportionally to each project's revenue
2. **Direct allocation** - Some expenses are clearly for one project (e.g., specific hosting)
3. **Fixed overhead rate** - e.g., 20% of revenue goes to overhead before profit calculation

**Recommendation:** Discuss with accountant which method is cleanest for tax purposes.

## What Happens When Bloom Pays

When SUO TECH INC sends a payment (e.g., $10,000):

```
Step 1: Identify the payment as Bloom project revenue
Step 2: Determine expenses for that period
Step 3: Allocate portion of expenses to Bloom (TBD method)
Step 4: Calculate: Bloom Profit = Bloom Revenue - Allocated Expenses
Step 5: Rami's Share = 50% × Bloom Profit
```

**Example:**
- SUO TECH INC payment: $10,000
- Monthly recurring expenses: $520
- Bloom allocation (say 100% since it's the only project): $520
- Bloom Profit: $10,000 - $520 = $9,480
- Rami's 50% share: **$4,740**

## Tax Considerations (Discuss with Accountant)

| Payment Method | Pros | Cons |
|----------------|------|------|
| **1099 Contractor** | Simple, no payroll | Rami pays 15.3% self-employment tax |
| **K-1 Distribution** | No payroll taxes | Complex, requires proper entity structure |
| **W-2 Wages** | Clean for taxes | Requires payroll (~15.3% FICA split) |
| **Guaranteed Payment** | If partnership | Treated like self-employment income |

**Key Question:** Is Rami a partner (with equity) or a contractor? This affects how profit share should be paid.
