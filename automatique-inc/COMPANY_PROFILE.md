## Outstanding Issues

### 1. Rami's Investment - NOT DOCUMENTED
**Critical:** Rami provided approximately $20,000 in startup capital via informal/handshake deal. This contribution is NOT memorialized in any corporate documents.

**Needs to be formalized as one of:**
- Stock purchase (equity - would need new share issuance)
- Convertible note / SAFE
- Loan to company (with or without interest)

**Action Item:** Consult with accountant Brandon on proper documentation approach.

**Investigation Needed:** Review Mercury bank statements to find:
- Date of Rami's contribution
- Exact amount transferred
- How it was recorded

### 2. S-Corp Election Decision
Company is currently a C-Corp. Need to evaluate:
- Benefits of S-Corp election for pass-through taxation
- Feasibility of retroactive election
- Reasonable salary requirements for owner-employees

### 3. Reasonable Compensation (if S-Corp)
If S-Corp elected, must pay "reasonable salary" to shareholder-employees working in the business.

## Questions for Accountant Brandon

1. **Rami's $20k contribution:** What's the best way to document this retroactively? Stock, note, or loan?

2. **S-Corp election:** Can we file Form 2553 retroactively for 2023, 2024, or 2025?

3. **Delaware Franchise Tax:** What's owed for 2023 and 2024? Any penalties for late payment?

4. **2023 partial year:** What needs to be filed for the May-Dec 2023 period?

5. **83(b) election:** Confirm this was properly filed and accepted by IRS.

6. **California compliance:** Is Automatique registered as a foreign corporation in CA? What filings are needed?
