## Important Notes for Accountant

### 1. Expenses Paid Personally

All 2023 business expenses were paid from Kurt's personal accounts:
- Wells Fargo checking account
- Privacy.com virtual cards

**Question:** Should this be treated as:
- A shareholder loan to the company? OR
- A capital contribution by Kurt?

### 2. No Corporate Bank Activity

Mercury corporate account had no transactions in 2023. All business activity flowed through personal accounts.

### 3. Contractor Payments

$10,000 paid to a developer ("Pablo") via Popstand (another company where Kurt is a cofounder). Payments were made via Zelle:
- July 2023: $4,000
- August 2023: $4,000
- September 2023: $2,000

**Question:** Is a 1099 required? Payments went to Popstand, not directly to the contractor.

### 4. Net Operating Loss

Company has a ~$16k NOL. What are the options for:
- Carrying forward under C-Corp rules?
- If S-Corp elected retroactively, passing through to Kurt's personal return?

## Questions for Brandon

### Structure Questions
1. **S-Corp vs C-Corp:** Given the loss year, is there any benefit to retroactive S-Corp election for 2023?
2. **Late Election:** Is Form 2553 late election relief available for 2023?

### Expense Treatment
3. **Personal Payment of Expenses:** How should we document Kurt paying $16k of company expenses from personal funds?
4. **Contractor Payments:** Are 1099s required for the $10k paid via Popstand?

### Compliance
5. **Delaware Franchise Tax:** What's owed for 2023? Any penalties for late payment?
6. **California Foreign Corp:** Does Automatique need to register as foreign corp in CA?
7. **Form 1120:** What's the deadline for the 2023 partial-year return? Are we subject to penalties?

### NOL Treatment
8. **C-Corp NOL:** How does the ~$16k loss carry forward?
9. **S-Corp NOL:** If we could elect S-Corp, could Kurt deduct this loss on his 2023 personal return?
