# Automatique Inc - 2024 Expenses Summary (UPDATED)

**Period:** January 1, 2024 - December 31, 2024
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-27
**Previous Total:** $14,017.63
**Updated Total (Business Expenses):** $19,903.17

---

## What Changed in This Update

An audit of the full Privacy.com source data revealed ~$5,885 in business SaaS/hosting expenses that were paid personally by Kurt but never captured in the original summary. The original extraction only pulled LegalZoom and Google Workspace from Privacy.com, missing Heroku (Jan-Sep), Bitrise (Jan-Jul), Midjourney, GoDaddy, GitHub, ChatGPT, and many other business subscriptions.

Additionally, personal bank records (Wells Fargo) contain expenses that could be partially deductible through the business if an accountable plan is established (cell phone, utilities, home office). These are listed separately with questions for the accountant.

## Questions for Accountant

### Newly Identified Expenses
1. **Privacy.com expenses:** Can the ~$5,886 in newly identified business SaaS expenses (Heroku, Bitrise, Midjourney, GoDaddy, etc.) be added to the 2024 return? These were clearly business expenses paid personally.
2. **Reimbursement treatment:** Should Kurt's personally-paid expenses (~$6,546 total: $660 original + $5,886 new) be treated as shareholder loan or capital contribution?

### Personal vs. Business
3. **Accountable plan:** Should Automatique establish an accountable plan to reimburse Kurt for home office, phone, internet, and utilities? Can this be done retroactively for 2024?
4. **Cell phone:** Can the business portion (~50-60%) of AT&T ($1,908/yr) be reimbursed through the corporation?
5. **Utilities:** Can the business portion of home utilities be reimbursed through the corporation? What business use percentage is appropriate?
6. **Home office:** Can Automatique reimburse Kurt for home office use (mortgage interest + property tax business portion)?
7. **If no accountable plan:** Do any of these personal expenses (phone, utilities, home office) go on Kurt's personal return instead? Or are they just lost as deductions for a C-Corp shareholder?

### Other
8. **Surety bond ($505):** Is this a business or personal expense? What is it for?
9. **Amazon purchases:** The Privacy.com data shows ~$8,000+ in Amazon purchases in 2024. Some may be business equipment. How should these be handled?
