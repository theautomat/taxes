## Important Notes for Accountant

### 1. Privacy.com Audit - ~$5,886 in Newly Found Business Expenses

A review of the full Privacy.com source data revealed that the original extraction only captured LegalZoom and Google Workspace ($660.22), missing ~$5,886 in business SaaS/hosting expenses. Key items: Heroku hosting (Jan-Sep, ~$1,859), Bitrise CI/CD (Jan-Jul, $847), Midjourney ($540), GoDaddy domains ($680), ChatGPT ($200), and many others.

These were all paid personally by Kurt via Privacy.com virtual cards for clear business purposes. This increases the 2024 NOL from ~$1,918 to ~$7,803.

**Question:** Can these be added to the 2024 return? How should Kurt's ~$6,546 in personally-paid expenses be treated (shareholder loan vs. capital contribution)?

### 2. Rami's $20,000 Contribution

Rami Elhaj wired $20,000 to the company on June 14, 2024. This is **NOT documented** as equity or a formal agreement.

**Questions:**
- Should this be equity (stock issuance)?
- A convertible note / SAFE?
- A loan to be repaid?
- A capital contribution?

### 3. PARO MARKETPLACE Charge

$3,449.60 charged on July 9, 2024 by PARO MARKETPLACE (accounting firm). This was a bad experience - they weren't a good fit but the charge couldn't be cancelled.

**Treatment:** Professional Services - Accounting

### 4. Personal Payment of Business Expenses

Kurt paid ~$6,545.76 of AUTOMATIQUE expenses from personal accounts (via Privacy.com virtual cards):
- Original: $660.22 (LegalZoom $372 + Google Workspace $288.22)
- Newly identified: ~$5,885.54 (Heroku, Bitrise, Midjourney, GoDaddy, GitHub, ChatGPT, etc.)

**Question:** Should this be treated as:
- Shareholder loan to the company?
- Capital contribution by Kurt?

### 5. NOL Carryforward (Updated)

Company has losses:
- 2023: ~$15,991 loss
- 2024: ~$7,803 loss (updated from ~$1,918)
- **Cumulative NOL: ~$23,794** (updated from ~$17,909)

How do these carry forward under C-Corp rules? Any implications if we elect S-Corp?

---

## Questions for Brandon

### Structure
1. **S-Corp Election:** Should we elect S-Corp for 2024 or future years?
2. **Retroactive Election:** Can we retroactively elect for 2023 to pass through the $16k loss?

### Treatment
3. **Rami's $20k:** How do we formalize this? What's cleanest given we're already in 2026?
4. **Personal Expenses:** How to document Kurt's ~$6,546 of personally-paid business expenses?
5. **Privacy.com expenses:** Can the ~$5,886 in newly identified business SaaS expenses be added to the 2024 return?

### Compliance
6. **George 1099:** Is a 1099 required for international contractor? What info do we need?
7. **Delaware Franchise Tax:** What's owed for 2024?
8. **California Foreign Corp:** Any CA compliance requirements?

### Filing
9. **2024 Return:** What's the deadline? Are we subject to late filing penalties?
10. **NOL Treatment:** How do cumulative losses (~$23,794) carry forward?
