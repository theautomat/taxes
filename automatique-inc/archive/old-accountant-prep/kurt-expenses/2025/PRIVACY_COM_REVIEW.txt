NOTE
================================================================================

2025 has much less Privacy.com activity because most business expenses
moved to the Mercury corporate card. The main expense still on Privacy.com
is LegalZoom for the registered agent service.

The $624 in "personally paid" expenses for 2025 that we already tracked
came from:
- LegalZoom: $384 (captured above)
- Pablochat (Discord): $240 (not in Privacy.com - paid elsewhere?)
