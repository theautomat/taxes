NOTES FOR ACCOUNTANT
--------------------

   may already be captured in company books - please verify to avoid
   double-counting

2. All Amazon purchases were reviewed item-by-item; only confirmed
   business equipment is included

3. Mercury expenses are complete from corporate bank statements

4. The $975.43 Amazon charge on Mercury (Oct 2025) is a Windows laptop
   purchased for testing Windows applications the company builds

5. 2023 EXPENSES ($16,815.90): All paid from Kurt's personal accounts:
   - $500 incorporation via Stripe Atlas

QUESTIONS FOR BRANDON:
---------------------
1. Can Automatique Inc reimburse Kurt for business expenses paid personally
   ($25,813.83 across 2023-2025)? What documentation is needed?
   Are there tax implications for the reimbursement?

2. 1099/W-8BEN REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTRACTORS:
   - George (international contractor, $8,105.31 via wire in 2024):
     Do we need a W-8BEN? Was there a filing obligation?
   - Pablo ($10,000 via Zelle to Popstand in 2023): Does Automatique
     need to file a 1099, or does Popstand handle that?
   - Sound Strats LLC ($2,000 in 2025): Do we need a 1099-NEC?
   - What are the penalties for late filing, and can they be filed late?
