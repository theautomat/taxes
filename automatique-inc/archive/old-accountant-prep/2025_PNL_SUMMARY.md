## NOL Carryforward Application

| Year | Revenue | Expenses | Net |
|------|---------|----------|-----|
| 2023 | $0 | $15,991 | ($15,991) NOL |
| 2024 | $12,100 | $20,821 | ($8,721) NOL |
| **Cumulative NOL** | | | **($24,712)** |
| 2025 | $88,080 | $15,740 | $72,340 gross |

### C-Corp NOL Application (Current Structure)
- 2025 Gross Income: $72,340.02
- Prior Year NOL (80% limit): min($24,712, $72,340 x 80%) = ($24,712.00)
- **2025 Estimated Taxable Income: $47,628.02**
- **Estimated Federal Tax (21%): $10,001.88**

### If S-Corp Were Elected
- Income would pass through to Kurt's personal return
- Subject to Kurt's marginal rate (~45.3% combined federal + CA)
- But NOL would also have passed through in prior years
- **Accountant should model both scenarios**
