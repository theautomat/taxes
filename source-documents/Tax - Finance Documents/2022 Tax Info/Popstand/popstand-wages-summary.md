## Appendix: Methodology for Creating This Verification Document

This section documents the step-by-step process used to create this verification document. It can serve as a guide for replicating this process for other years or income sources.

### Overview

This document was created by cross-referencing original Wells Fargo PDF statements with extracted CSV files to ensure 100% accuracy of all Popstand Inc income transactions.

### Step-by-Step Process

#### Step 1: Identify Income Sources to Verify

1. Read the main income summary document (e.g., `2022_popstand_income-summary.md`)
2. Identify all income types from the company:
   - Payroll deposits (W-2 wages via Gusto)
   - Wire transfers (K-1 distributions)
3. Note the expected totals from tax documents for comparison

#### Step 2: Read Source PDF Bank Statements

For each month being verified:

1. Use Read tool on the Wells Fargo PDF statement (e.g., `013122 WellsFargo.pdf`)
2. Search through each page for Popstand transactions:
   - **Wire transfers:** Look for pattern `WT Fed#[number]` + `Jpmorgan Chase Ban` + `/Org=Popstand Inc`
   - **Payroll deposits:** Look for pattern `Popstand Inc Payroll` + date code (e.g., `220114`)
3. For each transaction found, record:
   - Date
   - Fed reference number (wires) or payroll code
   - Amount
   - PDF page number

#### Step 3: Read Extracted CSV Files

For each month being verified:

1. Use Read tool on corresponding CSV file (e.g., `2022-01_wells-fargo_checking.csv`)
2. Search for matching Popstand transactions:
   - Search Description column for "Popstand", "WT Fed#", or specific reference numbers
3. Record the CSV line number for each matching transaction
4. Verify amounts match (accounting for negative signs in CSV for debits)

#### Step 4: Cross-Reference and Verify

For each transaction:

1. Confirm date matches between PDF and CSV
2. Confirm amount matches exactly
3. Confirm description contains key identifiers
4. Mark with ✓ when verified
5. Note any discrepancies immediately

#### Step 5: Create Verification Tables

For each month, document:

**Wire Transfers Table:**
```markdown
| Date | Fed Reference | Amount | PDF Page | CSV Line | Match |
```

**Payroll Table:**
```markdown
| Date | Description | Amount | PDF Page | CSV Line | Match |
```

**Monthly Summary:**
- Wire Transfer Subtotal (count + amount)
- Payroll Subtotal (count + amount)
- Total Popstand Income for month
- Verification status

#### Step 6: Calculate Totals and Compare to Tax Documents

1. Sum all wire transfers across all 12 months
2. Sum all payroll deposits across all 12 months
3. Calculate grand total from bank statements
4. Compare to tax documents:
   - **Payroll:** Compare to W-2 Box 1 (gross wages)
   - Account for tax withholdings to reconcile net vs gross
   - **Wire Transfers:** Compare to K-1 Line 16D (distributions)
5. Document and explain any discrepancies

### Example Verification Workflow

**Verifying a single transaction:**

1. **Open PDF:** `013122 WellsFargo.pdf`
2. **Find on Page 2:**
   ```
   01/04 WT Fed#08895 Jpmorgan Chase Ban /Org=Popstand Inc  $4,000.00
   ```
3. **Open CSV:** `2022-01_wells-fargo_checking.csv`
4. **Find Line 22:**
   ```csv
   2022-01-04,WT Fed#08895 Jpmorgan Chase Ban /Org=Popstand Inc,4000.00,...
   ```
5. **Verify:** Date matches, amount matches, description matches → ✓

### Quality Checks

- ✓ Every PDF transaction has matching CSV entry
- ✓ Every CSV Popstand entry has matching PDF transaction
- ✓ Amounts match exactly
- ✓ Dates match exactly
- ✓ Transaction counts match
- ✓ Subtotals calculated correctly
- ✓ Grand totals calculated correctly
- ✓ Compared to tax documents and discrepancies noted

### Tools Used

- **Read tool:** View PDFs (extracts text) and CSVs (shows line numbers)
- **Manual cross-referencing:** Compare PDF text to CSV data
- **Calculation:** Verify all subtotals and totals

### Tips for Future Verifications

1. **Process systematically:** One month at a time, in chronological order
2. **Don't skip ahead:** Resolve all discrepancies before moving to next month
3. **Document as you go:** Create tables immediately after verifying each month
4. **Watch for edge cases:**
   - Transactions on last day of month may appear in next statement
   - Wire transfers may take 1-2 days to clear
   - Service fees are separate transactions (don't include in income totals)
5. **Save frequently:** Mark months as verified to track progress
6. **Timing differences:** Bank statements (cash basis) vs tax returns (accrual basis) may differ
7. **Check your math:** Verify subtotals before moving to grand totals

### Why This Verification Was Necessary

The main income summary document (`2022_popstand_income-summary.md`) showed:
- K-1 reported distributions: $164,567
- Bank wire transfers: $211,200
- **Discrepancy:** $46,633

This verification document confirms the bank statement data is accurate and complete. The discrepancy requires further investigation (possibly timing differences between tax years, or classification differences between distributions and other payments).
