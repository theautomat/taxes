PART 3: IDENTIFYING DUPLICATES
==============================
Looking at this, I notice that in March 2022 there were CONVERT IN transactions
(where you converted something TO BTC) followed immediately by CONVERT OUT
transactions (where you converted BTC TO something else).

These are NOT duplicates - they are pairs:
- 2022-03-16: Convert IN 0.979 + 0.0244 BTC (you acquired BTC)
- 2022-03-17: Convert OUT 0.979424 + 0.024364 BTC (you disposed of that BTC)

The slight differences (0.979 vs 0.979424) might be rounding in your records.

The Jan/Feb 2022 sends ARE in our source CSV already - those were transfers, not sales.


PART 4: BALANCE CHECK BEFORE THE MARCH 2022 SALES
=================================================
Balance after 2021-09-25 (last transaction before 2022): 1.89424 BTC

2022 transactions before the March conversions:
- 2022-01-28: Send -0.0264 BTC (transfer, not sale)
- 2022-02-08: Send -0.114 BTC (transfer, not sale)

Balance before March 2022 activity: 1.89424 - 0.0264 - 0.114 = 1.75384 BTC

This is LESS than 1.609818 BTC we need to sell... wait, that's fine because
we also had the same-day Convert INs in March.


PART 5: THE ACTUAL DISPOSALS - WHERE DID THE BTC COME FROM?
===========================================================

DISPOSAL 1: 2022-03-17 - 0.979424 BTC to ETH
Origin: Converted IN on 2022-03-16 for $40,200.00
Cost Basis: $40,200.00
Proceeds: $39,443.30
Gain/Loss: -$756.70 (LOSS)

DISPOSAL 2: 2022-03-17 - 0.024364 BTC to ETH
Origin: Converted IN on 2022-03-16 for $1,000.01
Cost Basis: $1,000.01
Proceeds: $981.57
Gain/Loss: -$18.44 (LOSS)

DISPOSAL 3: 2022-03-24 - 0.116382 BTC to ETH
Origin: Converted IN on 2022-03-23 for $4,996.00
Cost Basis: $4,996.00

Gain/Loss: -$41.42 (LOSS)

DISPOSAL 5: 2022-03-29 - 0.447562 BTC to USDC
Origin: This came from OLDER holdings (not same-day)
This is the one that needs LIFO analysis.


PART 6: LIFO ANALYSIS FOR THE 0.447562 BTC SOLD ON 2022-03-29
=============================================================

Available BTC lots before 2022-03-29 (after the same-day conversions):
The balance was 1.75384 BTC, and we need 0.447562 BTC.

Using LIFO (Last In, First Out), we take from the most recent acquisitions:

LOT 1 (Most Recent): 2021-09-25 Convert In
Amount Available: 0.00236 BTC
Cost: $99.98
Cost per BTC: $42,364.41
USED: 0.00236 BTC @ $42,364.41 = $99.98 cost basis
Proceeds portion: 0.00236/0.447562 * $21,021.18 = $110.89
Gain/Loss: $110.89 - $99.98 = +$10.91 (GAIN)

LOT 2: 2021-03-24 Receive
Amount Available: 0.191 BTC
Cost: $9,996.13
Cost per BTC: $52,335.76
USED: 0.191 BTC @ $52,335.76 = $9,996.13 cost basis
Proceeds portion: 0.191/0.447562 * $21,021.18 = $8,970.49
Gain/Loss: $8,970.49 - $9,996.13 = -$1,025.64 (LOSS)

LOT 3: 2021-03-08 Receive
Amount Available: 0.41325 BTC (but we only need 0.254202 more)
Cost per BTC: $52,140.43 ($21,547.03 / 0.41325)
USED: 0.254202 BTC @ $52,140.43 = $13,254.02 cost basis
(0.254202 = 0.447562 - 0.00236 - 0.191)
Proceeds portion: 0.254202/0.447562 * $21,021.18 = $11,939.80
Gain/Loss: $11,939.80 - $13,254.02 = -$1,314.22 (LOSS)

TOTAL FOR 0.447562 BTC DISPOSAL:
Lots Used: 0.00236 + 0.191 + 0.254202 = 0.447562 BTC ✓
Total Cost Basis: $99.98 + $9,996.13 + $13,254.02 = $23,350.13
Total Proceeds: $21,021.18
Net Gain/Loss: -$2,328.95 (LOSS)

PART 8: VERIFICATION
====================
Total BTC Disposed: 0.979424 + 0.024364 + 0.116382 + 0.042086 + 0.447562 = 1.609818 ✓
Total Proceeds: $39,443.30 + $981.57 + $4,904.06 + $1,958.57 + $21,021.18 = $68,308.68 ✓
Total Cost Basis: $40,200.00 + $1,000.01 + $4,996.00 + $1,999.99 + $23,350.13 = $71,546.13
Net Loss: $68,308.68 - $71,546.13 = -$3,237.45

All short-term because:
- Same-day conversions: held < 1 day
- LIFO lots from 2021: held < 1 year when sold in March 2022
