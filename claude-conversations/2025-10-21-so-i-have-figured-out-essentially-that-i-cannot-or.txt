> so i have figured out essentially that i cannot or should not add office expenses and business expenses on my personal tax deductions because apparently they should be 
written off or expensed on the business, and so i'm considering having my accountant for the s corp go into the 1140 (1160?) S and have him edit the expenses, adding mine 
my and 50/50 expenses on the year 2022 creating an amendment for these expenses. first question i have is, is this true that i cannot add these expenses to my personal 
taxes? there are two documents you could look at, one is my personal profile that i wrote up and the other are some notes in the deductions section about office expenses. 
if it is true that it will be tough to add those expenses onto my personal filing for 2022 that is late and i'm preparing now then we should definitely organize the 
expenses so we can submit them to the popstand accountant for them to amend the expenses. can you look into that for me? and if you need to go on the web go ahead but if 
you know the code go ahead and advise. we can talk through and research together to come up with the right decision and move forward 

● I'll help you research this important tax question. Let me first look at your personal profile and deduction notes, then we can discuss the rules around business expenses
   for S-corp owners.

  personal return or the S-corp return. This is a crucial distinction for S-corp owners.

  Summary: Your Question About Business Expenses

  YES, you are correct! This is a critical finding. Let me explain:

  The Problem: TCJA Suspended Personal Deductions (2018-2025)

  You CANNOT deduct most business expenses on your personal tax return for 2022 because:

  1. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) suspended all miscellaneous itemized deductions subject to the 2% floor from 2018-2025
  2. This includes unreimbursed employee expenses that S-corp shareholder-employees used to claim on Schedule A
  3. Form 2106 (Employee Business Expenses) is essentially unusable for most taxpayers through 2025
  4. This means expenses like:
    - Office expenses
    - Cell phone (business portion)
    - Business mileage
    - Business equipment
    - Cannot be deducted on your personal 1040/Schedule A

  The Solution: S-Corp Amendment + Accountable Plan

  Your instinct is 100% correct - these expenses should be on Popstand's 1120-S corporate return, not your personal return:

  Path Forward:
  1. Amend Popstand's 2022 Form 1120-S to add business expenses
  2. Establish an Accountable Plan (or document that one existed) for 2022
  3. Reclassify payments as tax-free reimbursements to you (the shareholder-employee)
  4. Result:
    - S-corp gets the deduction (reduces corporate income)
    - You get tax-free reimbursement (not taxable income to you)
    - Total tax savings flows through to your K-1

  Critical Timing Information

  Good news - you're still within the window:

  - Amendment deadline: 3 years from filing date (or 2 years from tax paid, whichever is later)
  - If Popstand filed 2022 taxes on time (March 15, 2023), you have until ~April 2026 to amend
  - You have time! But should act soon

  How It Works

  Before Amendment:
  - Popstand S-corp: Higher taxable income → Higher K-1 to you
  - Your personal return: Can't deduct business expenses (TCJA suspension)
  - Result: You pay tax on income that should have been offset by expenses

  After Amendment:
  - Popstand S-corp: Lower taxable income (after deducting expenses)
  - Your personal return: Lower K-1 income received
  - Result: Tax savings without running into TCJA limitations

  Which Expenses to Include?

  Based on your documentation, you should consider adding these to Popstand's 1120-S:

  Home Office Expenses (15.2% business use):
  - Mortgage interest portion: $3,102
  - Property tax portion: $470
  - Utilities: ~$456
  - Insurance: ~$228
  - Subtotal: ~$4,256

  Office Expenses:
  - Cell phone (business %): $741-$1,038 (50-70% of $1,483)
  - Software subscriptions: (already claimed?)
  - Equipment purchases: $1,000-$3,000 (need to review Amazon)

  Vehicle Expenses:
  - Business mileage Fillmore↔Pasadena: $1,218-$3,656
  - Note: This one is trickier - needs mileage log documentation

  Estimated Total Opportunity: $7,000-$13,000 in deductions
  Tax Savings: $3,171-$5,889 (at your 45.3% combined rate)

  Important Considerations

  Accountable Plan Requirements:
  1. Business connection - Expenses must be business-related ✓
  2. Adequate substantiation - Receipts, records, documentation ✓
  3. Return excess - Only actual expenses reimbursed ✓
  4. Reasonable time period - IRS prefers 60 days, but case law (Namyst) shows annual reporting can work if documented

  Caution:
  - The IRS is suspicious of "year-end catch-up" reimbursements
  - Since you're amending 3 years later, you need strong documentation
  - Your accountant needs to establish/document the Accountable Plan properly

  Recommendation

  YES - Proceed with the S-corp amendment approach:

  1. Gather all documentation for business expenses you paid out-of-pocket in 2022
  2. Organize by category: home office, cell phone, equipment, mileage, etc.
  3. Work with your Popstand accountant to:
    - Establish/document Accountable Plan for 2022
    - Amend Form 1120-S (check box H(4), attach statement)
    - Add business expense deductions on corporate return
    - Issue amended K-1 to yourself with lower income
  4. File amended personal return (1040-X) reflecting the corrected K-1
  5. Result: Lower taxable income, potential refund

  Questions for Your Accountant

  1. Did Popstand have an Accountable Plan in place for 2022? (If not, can one be established retroactively?)
  2. What documentation is needed to support the amendment?
  3. Can home office expenses be reimbursed even though you also had the Pasadena office?
  4. Should we include cell phone, equipment, and mileage, or focus on home office only?
  5. What's the risk/audit exposure for amending 3 years later?

  ---
  Bottom Line: Your understanding is correct - these expenses belong on the S-corp return, not your personal return, due to TCJA. Organizing them for your accountant to
  amend the 1120-S is the right path forward. Would you like me to help organize the expense documentation to prepare for the amendment?

> ok so the best way to move forward is to make sure all of our applicable expenses can be added to popstand, i think the personal ones some of them can go on my personal 
schedule a, i'm not sure that if the schedule a can do mortgage interest then why add it to the business to lowere those taxes? i'd need some solid logic of what place 
might be the best for those.
