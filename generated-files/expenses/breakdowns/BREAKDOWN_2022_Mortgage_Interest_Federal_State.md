## Federal vs. California Treatment

### Federal Tax Treatment:

**Mortgage interest is deductible on:**
1. **Schedule A (Itemized Deductions)** - Personal portion
   - Line 8a: Home mortgage interest and points
   - Must itemize (exceed $12,950 single / $25,900 married standard deduction)

2. **Schedule C (Business Expenses)** - Home office portion
   - Part of home office deduction (Form 8829 or simplified method)
   - Only if claiming actual expense method for home office

### California Tax Treatment:

**California follows federal rules with minor differences:**
1. **Schedule CA (California Adjustments)** - Itemized deductions
   - Generally matches federal treatment
   - Standard deduction: $5,202 (single) / $10,404 (married)

2. **Schedule C** - Business portion (same as federal)

**Key California Difference:**
- Property tax deduction NOT capped at $10,000 on CA return (federal has $10k SALT cap)
- Mortgage interest treatment is the same

---

## Option 1: All Personal (Schedule A Only)

**Deduction Amount:** $20,410.43 (full amount)

### Federal Tax Savings:
- Assuming 24% tax bracket
- $20,410.43 × 24% = **$4,899 federal savings**

### California Tax Savings:
- Assuming 9.3% CA tax bracket (typical for $100-200k income)
- $20,410.43 × 9.3% = **$1,898 CA savings**

### **Total Tax Savings (Option 1): $6,797**

**Pros:**
- Simple, straightforward
- No home office complications
- Clean for home sale (no depreciation recapture)

**Cons:**
- Misses opportunity for SE tax savings on business portion
- Lower overall tax savings vs. split method

---

## Option 2: Split Between Home Office & Personal (RECOMMENDED)

**Home Office Business Use:** 15.2% (225 sq ft ÷ 1,480 sq ft)

### Business Portion (Schedule C):
- $20,410.43 × 15.2% = **$3,102.39**
- Tax rate: 24% income + 15.3% SE tax = **39.3%**
- Tax savings: $3,102.39 × 39.3% = **$1,219 federal**

### Personal Portion (Schedule A):
- $20,410.43 × 84.8% = **$17,308.04**
- Federal tax rate: 24%
- Federal savings: $17,308.04 × 24% = **$4,154**
- CA tax rate: 9.3%
- CA savings: $17,308.04 × 9.3% = **$1,610**

### **Total Tax Savings (Option 2): $6,983**

**Advantage over Option 1: +$186 additional savings**

**Pros:**
- Maximum tax savings (captures SE tax savings)
- Legitimate business expense deduction
- No depreciation if using actual expense method WITHOUT depreciation

**Cons:**
- Slightly more complex calculation
- Requires documenting home office use
- If claiming depreciation, creates recapture obligation at sale

## Itemized vs. Standard Deduction Analysis

**Question:** Should you itemize, or take the standard deduction?

### 2022 Standard Deductions:
- **Federal:**
  - Single: $12,950
  - Married filing jointly: $25,900
- **California:**
  - Single: $5,202
  - Married filing jointly: $10,404

### Your Potential Itemized Deductions (Federal):

| Deduction Category | Amount | Notes |
|-------------------|---------|-------|
| **Mortgage Interest (personal)** | $17,308.04 | 84.8% of $20,410.43 |
| **Property Taxes** | $3,095.19 | Full amount (under $10k cap) |
| **State Income Taxes** | TBD | Capped at $10k total with property tax |
| **State + Property Tax Cap** | $10,000.00 | SALT cap applies |
| **Charitable Contributions** | TBD | If any in 2022 |
| **Medical Expenses (over 7.5% AGI)** | TBD | Unlikely to exceed threshold |
| **SUBTOTAL (known)** | **$27,308+** | Mortgage + SALT cap |

**Conclusion:** You should **ITEMIZE** on federal return
- Your mortgage + taxes alone = $27,308 (exceeds $25,900 standard deduction)

### California Itemized Deductions:

| Deduction Category | Amount | Notes |
|-------------------|---------|-------|
| **Mortgage Interest (personal)** | $17,308.04 | 84.8% of $20,410.43 |
| **Property Taxes** | $3,095.19 | NO CAP on CA (unlike federal) |
| **State Income Taxes** | N/A | Can't deduct on state return |
| **SUBTOTAL** | **$20,403** | |

**Conclusion:** You should **ITEMIZE** on CA return
- $20,403 exceeds $10,404 standard deduction (married) or $5,202 (single)

## Integration with Home Office Deduction

### If Using Simplified Method ($5/sq ft):
- **All mortgage interest goes to Schedule A** (personal)
- Simplified method doesn't use actual expenses
- Total deduction: $20,410.43 on Schedule A

### If Using Actual Expense Method:

  - Business: $3,102.39 → Schedule C (via Form 8829)
  - Personal: $17,308.04 → Schedule A

- **Also allocate on Form 8829:**
  - Property taxes (15.2%)
  - Utilities (15.2%)
  - Insurance (15.2%)
  - Repairs (15.2%)
  - Optional: Depreciation (15.2%)

### Recommended: Actual Expense Method WITHOUT Depreciation
- Maximum deduction
- Captures SE tax savings
- No depreciation recapture at home sale

## Special Considerations

### 1. Mortgage Interest Limitation

**Pre-2018 Mortgages (Grandfathered):**
- Deductible on loans up to $1,000,000
- Your loan: $760,750 → **Fully deductible**

**Post-2018 Mortgages:**
- Deductible on loans up to $750,000
- If refinanced after 12/15/2017, check if grandfathered

**Your Loan Origination:** 01/08/2022 (from Form 1098)
- This is a 2022 loan (post-TCJA)
- Subject to $750,000 limit
- Your balance ($760,750) **slightly exceeds** the $750,000 limit

**Calculation if Limited:**
- Deductible: $750,000 ÷ $760,750 = 98.6% of interest
- Deductible amount: $20,410.43 × 98.6% = $20,124.69
- Non-deductible: $285.74

**Note:** Check if this is a refinance of a pre-2018 loan (grandfathered) or a new purchase loan. If refinance of grandfathered loan, $1M limit may apply.

### 2. Points Paid at Closing

**Question:** Were any points paid when obtaining the mortgage in 2022?

**If Yes:**
- Points on purchase loan: Deductible in year paid
- Points on refinance: Amortized over loan life
- Check closing documents (HUD-1 or Closing Disclosure)

**Not shown on Form 1098** - may need to add separately if applicable

### 3. Home Equity Loan Interest

**2022 Rules:**
- Interest deductible if used to buy, build, or improve home
- Not deductible if used for other purposes (debt consolidation, etc.)

**Your Loan:** Appears to be standard mortgage, not HELOC

### 4. Married Filing Separately

**If filing separately:**
- Each spouse can deduct their portion
- $10,000 SALT cap becomes $5,000 per spouse
- Standard deduction: $12,950 per spouse

## Questions for Tax Professional

1. **Loan grandfathering:** Is this a refinance of a pre-2018 mortgage (subject to $1M limit vs. $750k)?
2. **Loan balance limitation:** Do we need to prorate interest due to $760,750 balance exceeding $750k limit?
3. **Points deduction:** Were any points paid at closing in 2022?
4. **SALT cap strategy:** With high CA income taxes, should we maximize property tax on CA return?
5. **Home office method:** Confirm actual expense method WITHOUT depreciation is optimal approach?
6. **Filing status:** Single or married filing jointly? (affects standard deduction comparison)
