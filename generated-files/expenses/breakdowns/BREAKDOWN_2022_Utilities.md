## Complete Utilities Estimate (Including Missing)

### If we locate Spectrum and Trash:
- Edison: $2,661.40
- Gas: $488.35
- Water: $230.00 (known, likely ~$920-1,200 for full year)
- Spectrum: ~$2,460
- Trash: ~$574
- **Estimated total: $6,413 - $6,693**

### Business Portion (15.2%):
- **$6,413 × 15.2% = $974.78**
- **$6,693 × 15.2% = $1,017.34**

### Tax Savings (if all found):
- **~$975-1,017 × 39.3% = $383-400 additional savings**

## Comparison to Original Estimate

### Original Estimate (in Home Office Summary):
- "Utilities/insurance estimated: ~$456"
- Based on typical home costs

### Actual Found:
- Known utilities (Edison + Gas + Water partial): $513.72 business portion
- **Already exceeds estimate by $58!**

### With Missing Utilities Added:
- Edison + Gas + Water (full year est.) + Spectrum + Trash
- Business portion: ~$975-1,017
- **More than double the original estimate**

**Revised home office deduction estimate:**
- Mortgage interest: $3,102.39
- Property taxes: $470.47
- Utilities (found): $513.72
- **Known total: $4,086.58**
- **Plus missing utilities: +$461-503**
- **Complete total: $4,548-4,590**

## Missing Payment Analysis

### Why only 1 water payment found?

**Possible explanations:**
1. **Home purchased in January 2022** - prior payments under previous owner
2. **Quarterly billing** - Only 4 payments/year expected (Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct)
3. **Other payment methods** - User notes indicate calling to pay with credit card
4. **Two accounts** - User has 021509-000 AND 021509-001 (different properties?)

**Conservative approach:**
- Use only the $230 found for now
- Note that full year is likely $920-1,200 (4 quarters × $230-300)

### Why no Spectrum or Trash?

**Most likely:**
- Both paid via credit card (user notes confirm)
- Not in Wells Fargo checking account data
- Need to search credit card statements
