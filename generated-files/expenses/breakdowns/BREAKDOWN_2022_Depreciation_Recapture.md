## What is Depreciation Recapture?

When you claim depreciation on your home office, the IRS requires you to "recapture" (pay back) some of that tax benefit when you sell your home.

**Key Facts:**
- Recapture applies ONLY if you claimed depreciation (actual expense method)
- Simplified method ($5/sq ft) does NOT create recapture obligation
- Recapture is taxed at 25% (unrecaptured Section 1250 gain)
- You MUST recapture even if you don't sell at a profit

---

## How Depreciation Recapture Works

### Step 1: You Claim Depreciation Annually
Each year you claim home office deduction using actual expenses, you depreciate a portion of your home's value.

**Formula:**
- Home Value (excluding land) ÷ 39 years × Business Use %

### Step 2: When You Sell
The IRS taxes you on ALL depreciation claimed at 25%, reducing your capital gains exclusion.

**Impact on Capital Gains:**
- Normal: $250k exclusion (single) or $500k (married) on home sale profit
- With depreciation recapture: Depreciation amount is taxed at 25% FIRST, then remaining gain gets exclusion

## Scenario Analysis: 10-Year Hold Period

**Assumptions:**
- Home Office: 225 sq ft
- Business Use: 12.5% (assuming 1,800 sq ft home)
- Hold Period: 10 years (2022-2032)
- Home Value (building only): $600,000
- Tax Bracket: 24% income, 15.3% SE tax, 25% recapture

---

### Scenario A: WITHOUT Depreciation (Actual Expenses, No Depreciation)

**Annual Deductions (2022 example):**
- Mortgage Interest (12.5%): $2,551
- Property Taxes (12.5%): $387
- **Total Annual Deduction: $2,938**

**10-Year Tax Savings:**
- Annual savings: $2,938 × 39.3% = $1,155/year
- **10-Year Total: $11,550 saved**

**At Sale (2032):**
- No depreciation to recapture
- Full $250k/$500k capital gains exclusion applies
- **Recapture Tax: $0**

**Net Benefit: $11,550**

---

### Scenario B: WITH Depreciation

**Annual Depreciation Calculation:**
- Building Value: $600,000
- Annual Depreciation: $600,000 ÷ 39 years = $15,385
- Business Portion: $15,385 × 12.5% = **$1,923/year**

**Annual Deductions (2022 example):**
- Mortgage Interest (12.5%): $2,551
- Property Taxes (12.5%): $387
- Depreciation (12.5%): $1,923
- **Total Annual Deduction: $4,861**

**10-Year Tax Savings:**
- Annual savings: $4,861 × 39.3% = $1,910/year
- **10-Year Total: $19,100 saved**

**At Sale (2032):**
- Total depreciation claimed: $1,923 × 10 years = $19,230
- Recapture tax: $19,230 × 25% = **$4,808 owed**
- Plus: Potential reduction of capital gains exclusion

**Net Benefit: $19,100 - $4,808 = $14,292**

**Advantage over No Depreciation: $14,292 - $11,550 = $2,742**

## Break-Even Analysis

**Question:** At what holding period does depreciation become advantageous?

**Answer:** Immediately. Even with a 1-year hold:
- Year 1 tax savings with depreciation: $1,910
- Year 1 tax savings without depreciation: $1,155
- Extra savings: $755
- Recapture cost (if sold after 1 year): $481
- **Net advantage: $274**

**Conclusion:** Depreciation is ALWAYS financially beneficial, even with short hold periods, because you save at 39.3% but pay back at only 25%.

## Special Considerations

### Capital Gains Exclusion Impact

If your home sale profit exceeds $250k/$500k exclusion:

**Example: $600k Profit on Sale**
- Married filing jointly: $500k exclusion
- Taxable gain: $100k
- With $20k depreciation:
  - First $20k taxed at 25% = $5,000
  - Remaining $80k taxed at 15-20% capital gains rate = $12,000-$16,000
  - **Total tax: $17,000-$21,000**
- Without depreciation:
  - All $100k taxed at 15-20% = $15,000-$20,000
  - **Total tax: $15,000-$20,000**

**Impact:** Minimal difference because recapture rate (25%) is close to long-term capital gains rate (15-20%)

---

## Risk Factors to Consider

### 1. Home Value Decline
- If home loses value, you still owe recapture on depreciation claimed
- Example: Claimed $20k depreciation, home sells at a loss
- You still pay $5,000 recapture tax even if you didn't profit

### 2. Death Before Sale
- Heirs get "step-up" in basis to fair market value at death
- Depreciation recapture obligation is FORGIVEN
- If you die owning the home, heirs avoid all recapture tax
- **Strategy:** If you plan to pass home to heirs, depreciation is a "free" benefit

### 3. 1031 Exchange
- Can defer capital gains tax with like-kind exchange
- But cannot defer depreciation recapture
- Recapture is due at time of exchange

### 4. Convert to Full Rental
- If you convert home to full rental property (not just home office)
- Different rules apply (27.5 year schedule, no Section 121 exclusion)
- More complex tax treatment

---

## Simplified Method Alternative

**Reminder: Simplified Method Avoids All This Complexity**

- **Deduction:** $1,125/year (225 sq ft × $5)
- **Tax Savings:** $442/year (39.3% rate)
- **10-Year Savings:** $4,420
- **Recapture:** $0
- **Paperwork:** Minimal

**Comparison to Depreciation Method:**
- Depreciation: $14,292 net benefit (after recapture)
- Simplified: $4,420 net benefit
- **Difference: $9,872 over 10 years**

**Is the extra $9,872 worth the complexity and risk?**
- If you're selling soon or want simplicity: Maybe not
- If you're staying long-term and want max deduction: Yes

---

## Decision Framework

### Use **Simplified Method** ($5/sq ft) if:
- ✓ You plan to sell within 3-5 years
- ✓ You value simplicity over maximum deduction
- ✓ You're uncomfortable with recapture risk
- ✓ Your home may decline in value
- ✓ You don't want to track detailed expenses
- ✓ You have a small office space (<200 sq ft)

### Use **Actual Expenses WITHOUT Depreciation** if:
- ✓ You want higher deductions than simplified method
- ✓ You want to avoid recapture completely
- ✓ You're willing to track home expenses
- ✓ You have large deductible expenses (high mortgage, taxes, utilities)
- ✓ You want flexibility to sell without tax complications

### Use **Actual Expenses WITH Depreciation** if:
- ✓ You plan to hold the home 5+ years
- ✓ You want maximum current-year tax savings
- ✓ You understand and accept recapture obligation
- ✓ You're comfortable with additional paperwork
- ✓ Your home is likely to appreciate (making recapture percentage smaller)
- ✓ You may pass home to heirs (recapture forgiven at death)
- ✓ You're OK with slightly more audit risk

   - Comfort with complexity
   - Risk tolerance
   - Desire for maximum deduction

2. **If choosing actual expenses:**
   - Gather all 2022 home expense receipts
   - Calculate exact business percentage
   - Determine if including depreciation

3. **Document everything:**
   - Photos of dedicated office space
   - Floor plan showing exclusive use
   - Records of home measurements
   - All expense receipts

4. **Consult tax professional:**
   - Verify qualification for home office deduction
   - Confirm calculation methodology
   - Discuss your specific situation
   - Plan for future years

---

## Summary

**Depreciation Recapture is NOT as scary as it sounds:**
- You save at 39.3% (income + SE tax)
- You pay back at 25% (recapture rate)
- **Net arbitrage: 14.3 percentage points in your favor**

**Over 10 years with 12.5% business use:**
- Save $19,100 in taxes
- Pay back $4,808 at sale
- **Net gain: $14,292**

**The math favors depreciation if you're staying in the home.**

But if you value simplicity or plan to sell soon, actual expenses WITHOUT depreciation is a great middle ground.
