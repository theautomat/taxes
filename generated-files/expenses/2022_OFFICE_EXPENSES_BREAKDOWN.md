**Analysis:**
- **No internet provider payments found** in Wells Fargo checking account
- AT&T payments likely for phone service (not deductible unless business line)
- User mentioned internet might be Spectrum, but no Spectrum transactions found

**Possible Explanations:**
1. **Internet included in office rent** (most likely scenario)
2. Internet paid via credit card (not Wells Fargo checking)
3. Internet paid via different payment method (Zelle to landlord, etc.)
4. Internet was landlord's responsibility

**Tax Treatment:**
- If internet included in rent: Already covered in rent reimbursement (not separately deductible)
- If internet paid separately via different account: Need to locate those transactions
- **Action needed:**
  - Check credit card statements for Spectrum/internet payments Oct-Dec 2022
  - Verify with lease agreement if internet was included in rent
  - If internet was paid separately and not reimbursed, locate payment records
