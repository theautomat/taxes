## Key Finding: Pasadena Office Actually HELPS Your Home Office Deduction

**Your Situation:**
- Home office in Fillmore (225 sq ft)
- Company-rented office space in Pasadena (reimbursed by company)
- Split time between both locations

**Good News:**
1. **Reimbursed office rent is NOT taxable income** (accountable plan)
2. **Home office STILL qualifies** under IRS "administrative or management activities" test
3. **You can claim BOTH:**
   - Reimbursements for Pasadena office (not taxable)
   - Home office deduction (tax deductible)

**IRS Rule:** Home qualifies as principal place of business if you use it for substantial administrative/management activities, **even if you also conduct business at another location**.

## Pasadena Office Rent Reimbursements

**Tax Treatment:**
- **Reimbursements: NOT taxable income** (under accountable plan rules)
- **You don't report as income**
- **Company deducts as business expense**
- **This is SEPARATE from your home office deduction**

**Requirements for accountable plan:**
1. ✓ Business connection (office space for work)
2. ✓ Adequate accounting (receipts/invoices submitted)
3. ✓ Return excess (no excess reimbursements to return)

**Action Required:**
- Verify these reimbursement transactions are NOT included in income
- Document with lease agreements, rent receipts, parking receipts
- Keep separate from home office calculation

**Important:** These reimbursements DO NOT reduce or affect your home office deduction.

## IRS Qualification - You're in Good Shape

**Principal Place of Business Test:**

Your home office qualifies because:
1. **Administrative/Management Activities:** Even though you also work in Pasadena, if you use your home office for:
   - Client communications
   - Administrative tasks
   - Planning and management
   - Coding and development work

2. **Exclusive Use:** 225 sq ft room used exclusively for business

3. **Regular Use:** Used consistently throughout 2022

**IRS specifically allows home office even when you have another workplace.**

From IRS Pub 587:
> "If you use your home office for administrative or management activities and have no other fixed location where you conduct these activities, your home office qualifies as your principal place of business."

**Why:**

- With utilities/insurance: **~$1,583**

- **Extra savings: $1,141-$1,962/year**

### If You Want Maximum Deduction: **Option 3 (With Depreciation)**

**Extra annual savings:** ~$740-$920/year over Option 2
**10-year net benefit after recapture:** ~$3,342-$5,342 more

**Worth it if:**
- You're staying in home 7+ years
