## Method 1: Simplified Method

**Calculation:** $5 per square foot, maximum 300 sq ft

**Home Office Deduction:**
- 225 sq ft × $5/sq ft = **$1,125**

**Pros:**
- Simple, no detailed expense tracking needed
- No depreciation of home (avoids recapture on sale)
- Less audit risk
- Easy to calculate and document

**Cons:**
- Lower deduction amount
- Cannot also deduct actual home expenses
- Cannot deduct depreciation

**Tax Savings (24% bracket + 15.3% SE tax = 39.3%):**
- $1,125 × 39.3% = **~$442 tax savings**

## Method 2: Actual Expense Method

### Home Expenses Eligible for Deduction

Using actual home square footage percentages from above scenarios:

#### Direct Expenses (100% deductible for office)
- Office repairs, painting, improvements: $[AMOUNT]
- Office furniture, fixtures: $[AMOUNT]

#### Indirect Expenses (Business % deductible)
These expenses benefit the entire home:

| Expense Category | Annual Amount | 9% Business | 11.25% Business | 12.5% Business | 15% Business |
|------------------|---------------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Mortgage Interest** | $20,410.43 | $1,836.94 | $2,296.17 | $2,551.30 | $3,061.56 |
| **Property Taxes** | $3,095.19 | $278.57 | $348.21 | $386.90 | $464.28 |
| **Homeowners Insurance** | $[AMOUNT] | [9%] | [11.25%] | [12.5%] | [15%] |
| **Utilities (Electric/Gas)** | $[AMOUNT] | [9%] | [11.25%] | [12.5%] | [15%] |
| **Water/Trash** | $[AMOUNT] | [9%] | [11.25%] | [12.5%] | [15%] |
| **HOA Fees** | $[AMOUNT] | [9%] | [11.25%] | [12.5%] | [15%] |
| **Home Repairs/Maintenance** | $[AMOUNT] | [9%] | [11.25%] | [12.5%] | [15%] |
| **Depreciation** | $[AMOUNT] | [9%] | [11.25%] | [12.5%] | [15%] |

### Partial Year Calculation: Mortgage Interest + Property Taxes Only

Since you also worked at Pasadena office, we can calculate a conservative estimate with just the major expenses:

#### Scenario: 12.5% Business Use (1,800 sq ft home)

**Known Expenses:**
- Mortgage Interest: $20,410.43 × 12.5% = $2,551.30
- Property Taxes: $3,095.19 × 12.5% = $386.90
- **Subtotal (without utilities, insurance, etc.): $2,938.20**

**Tax Savings (39.3%):**
- $2,938.20 × 39.3% = **~$1,155 tax savings**

**Comparison to Simplified Method:**
- Actual method (partial): ~$1,155 savings
- Simplified method: ~$442 savings
- **Advantage: +$713 more savings** (even without including all expenses!)

#### Scenario: 15% Business Use (1,500 sq ft home)

**Known Expenses:**
- Mortgage Interest: $20,410.43 × 15% = $3,061.56
- Property Taxes: $3,095.19 × 15% = $464.28
- **Subtotal: $3,525.84**

**Tax Savings (39.3%):**
- $3,525.84 × 39.3% = **~$1,386 tax savings**

**Comparison to Simplified Method:**
- Actual method (partial): ~$1,386 savings
- Simplified method: ~$442 savings
- **Advantage: +$944 more savings**

## Depreciation Calculation (If Using Actual Method)

**[WARNING: Creates recapture obligation on home sale]**

### Step 1: Determine Depreciable Basis
- Home Purchase Price: $[AMOUNT NEEDED]
- Plus: Closing costs and capital improvements: $[AMOUNT]
- Less: Land value (not depreciable): $[AMOUNT]
- **Depreciable Basis (building only): $[AMOUNT]**

### Step 2: Calculate Annual Depreciation
- Residential rental property: 27.5 years straight-line
- Business use of home: 39 years straight-line
- Annual Depreciation = Depreciable Basis ÷ 39 years
- Business Portion = Annual Depreciation × Business %

### Example: $600,000 Home, 20% Land, 12.5% Business Use
- Purchase Price: $600,000
- Less Land (20%): $120,000
- Building Value: $480,000
- Annual Depreciation: $480,000 ÷ 39 = $12,307.69
- Business Portion: $12,307.69 × 12.5% = **$1,538.46/year**

**Tax Savings from Depreciation:**
- $1,538.46 × 39.3% = ~$605/year additional savings

**Recapture Cost When Selling:**
- Total depreciation taken over 10 years: $15,384.60
- Recapture tax (25% rate): $3,846.15
- Net benefit: $6,050 saved - $3,846 recaptured = $2,204 net gain
