## Tax Deduction Options

### Option 1: Personal Itemized Deduction (Schedule A)
**Full Amount Available:** $20,410.43

**Pros:**
- Simple, straightforward deduction
- No depreciation recapture issues when you sell
- No home office paperwork or measurements needed

**Cons:**
- Only beneficial if you itemize (total itemized deductions exceed standard deduction)
- 2022 Standard Deduction: $12,950 (single) or $25,900 (married filing jointly)
- Need to consider all itemized deductions: mortgage interest + property taxes + state taxes + charitable, etc.

**Effective Benefit:**
- If itemizing and in 24% tax bracket: ~$4,898 tax savings
- If itemizing and in 32% tax bracket: ~$6,531 tax savings

---

### Option 2: Home Office Deduction (Schedule C Business Expense)

**IF claiming home office deduction:**

The mortgage interest gets split:
- **Business Portion:** Allocated to home office (Schedule C)
- **Personal Portion:** Remaining amount (Schedule A if itemizing)

**This creates a tradeoff:**
- **Benefit:** Business portion reduces self-employment income (saves both income tax AND self-employment tax ~15.3%)
- **Cost:** Personal portion may not be deductible if you don't itemize
- **Risk:** Depreciation recapture when selling home

## Calculation Example (Hypothetical Home Office Scenarios)

### Scenario A: 10% Home Office
Assume 10% of home used exclusively for business

**Mortgage Interest Allocation:**
- Business Portion (Schedule C): $2,041.04 (10% × $20,410.43)
- Personal Portion (Schedule A): $18,369.39 (90% × $20,410.43)

**Tax Savings (24% bracket + 15.3% SE tax):**
- Business portion: $2,041.04 × 39.3% = ~$802 savings
- Personal portion: $18,369.39 × 24% = ~$4,409 savings (if itemizing)
- **Total: ~$5,211 savings**

**Comparison to Option 1:**
- Option 1 (all personal): ~$4,898 savings
- Option 2 (10% business): ~$5,211 savings
- **Advantage: ~$313 more savings**

### Scenario B: 15% Home Office
Assume 15% of home used exclusively for business

**Mortgage Interest Allocation:**
- Business Portion (Schedule C): $3,061.56 (15% × $20,410.43)
- Personal Portion (Schedule A): $17,348.87 (85% × $20,410.43)

**Tax Savings (24% bracket + 15.3% SE tax):**
- Business portion: $3,061.56 × 39.3% = ~$1,203 savings
- Personal portion: $17,348.87 × 24% = ~$4,164 savings (if itemizing)
- **Total: ~$5,367 savings**

**Comparison to Option 1:**
- Option 1 (all personal): ~$4,898 savings
- Option 2 (15% business): ~$5,367 savings
- **Advantage: ~$469 more savings**

## Additional Deductible Items

### Property Taxes: $3,095.19
- Deductible on Schedule A (if itemizing)
- If claiming home office, split between business/personal

### Mortgage Insurance (PMI): $887.50
- May be deductible on Schedule A (subject to income limits and legislation)
- Consult accountant on current year deductibility rules

### Other Home Expenses (if using Actual Expense Method for home office)
- Homeowners Insurance
- HOA Fees (if applicable)
- Utilities (electricity, gas, water, trash)
- Home Maintenance and Repairs (business portion)
- **Depreciation** (see separate depreciation analysis)

---

## Decision Framework

### Choose **Personal Only (Schedule A)** if:
- You prefer simplicity
- You're concerned about depreciation recapture
- You plan to sell the home in the next few years
- Your home office percentage would be very small (<5%)
- You work primarily from the Pasadena office

### Choose **Home Office (Split Business/Personal)** if:
- You have a dedicated, exclusive home office space
- Home is your principal place of business OR used for administrative work
- You want to maximize deductions (especially to reduce SE tax)
- You're comfortable with additional paperwork and requirements
- You don't plan to sell soon (or accept the depreciation recapture)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Determine Home Office Percentage:**
   - Measure home office square footage
   - Measure total home square footage
   - Calculate business use percentage

2. **Calculate Actual Home Office Deduction:**
   - Compare simplified method ($5/sq ft, max $1,500) vs. actual expense method
   - Factor in all home expenses (utilities, insurance, etc.)

3. **Evaluate Depreciation Impact:**
   - Understand depreciation recapture rules
   - Calculate potential recapture tax on future home sale
   - Decide if simplified method is better (no depreciation)

4. **Consult Tax Professional:**
   - Review your specific situation
   - Consider state tax implications
   - Determine optimal strategy based on overall tax picture
