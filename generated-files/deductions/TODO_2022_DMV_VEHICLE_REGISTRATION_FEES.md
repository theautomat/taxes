# TODO: 2022 DMV Vehicle Registration Fees

## Status
**OUTSTANDING** - Document not yet located

## What We Need
DMV vehicle registration fees paid in 2022 are deductible as part of California state and local taxes (SALT) on Schedule A, subject to the $10,000 cap.

## Where to Look
1. **DMV renewal notices** - Check mail/email from California DMV in 2022
2. **Bank/credit card statements** - Search for:
   - "DMV"
   - "Department of Motor Vehicles"
   - "Vehicle Registration"
   - Payments to CA DMV website
3. **Online DMV account** - Log in to dmv.ca.gov to view payment history
4. **Vehicle registration card** - Shows expiration date (can calculate when payment was due)

## California DMV Registration Fees (Typical)
For a passenger vehicle, typical annual registration fees in CA range from $200-$500+ depending on:
- Vehicle value (based on depreciation schedule)
- County of residence (Ventura County for Fillmore, CA)
- Vehicle weight fees
- License plate fees

## Tax Deduction Details
- **Deductible portion:** Vehicle license fee (VLF) only - this is the portion based on vehicle value
- **NOT deductible:** Other fees like registration, weight fees, special plates
- **Schedule:** Report on Schedule A (Itemized Deductions), Line 5c - "Other state and local taxes"
- **SALT cap:** Combined with property taxes and state income taxes (max $10,000 total)

## Next Steps
- [ ] Check email for DMV renewal notices (2022)
- [ ] Review bank statements Jan-Dec 2022 for DMV payments
- [ ] Log in to dmv.ca.gov and check payment history
- [ ] If found, add documentation to accountant preparation folder
- [ ] Calculate deductible VLF portion (usually ~65% of total registration fee)

## Notes
Given the $10,000 SALT cap and property tax payment of $24,430 already claimed,
DMV fees may not provide additional deduction benefit. However, we should still
document them for completeness and accuracy.
