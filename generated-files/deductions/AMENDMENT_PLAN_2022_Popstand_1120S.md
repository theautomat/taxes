## Important Considerations

### Partnership Agreement
- Both shareholders (50/50 owners) must agree to amendment
- Both will receive revised K-1s
- Both must file amended personal returns
- Chris's tax liability also decreases by ~$5,064

### 1099-NEC Requirement
- If contractor payment ($1,500) was not reported with 1099-NEC, must file now
- Late filing penalties may apply
- File Form 1096 (transmittal) with late 1099-NEC

### Home Office Depreciation
- Using actual expenses method WITHOUT depreciation
- This avoids depreciation recapture when selling home
- If depreciation desired, must use Form 4562

### Audit Risk
- Amendments slightly increase audit risk
- Having strong documentation mitigates risk
- All expenses have clear business purpose
- Conservative approach: Only include well-documented expenses

## Questions for Accountant/Tax Professional

1. Should home office be claimed via Form 8829 or as "Other deductions"?
2. Is late 1099-NEC required for contractor payment? What penalties?
3. Should we include Section 179 depreciation for any equipment?
4. Are there any other missed deductions we should include?
5. What is the exact California adjustment for home office deduction?
6. Should we file electronically or by mail?
