## Potential Overlooked Deductions (Research Needed)

### 1. Vehicle Expenses
**Current Status:** No vehicle expenses found in checking account data
**Opportunity:**
- Business mileage: Home office (Fillmore) ↔ Pasadena office (Oct-Dec)
- Distance: ~75 miles one-way (Fillmore to Pasadena) = 150 miles round trip
- Frequency: [Need to determine days per week]
- **Example calculation:** 2 days/week × 13 weeks × 150 miles = 3,900 miles
- **Deduction:** 3,900 miles × $0.625/mile (Jul-Dec rate) = **$2,437.50**
- **Tax savings:** $2,437.50 × 39.3% = **$958 savings**
**Action needed:** Verify commute frequency and whether home office → Pasadena = business mileage

### 2. California-Specific Deductions
**Renter's Credit:** N/A (homeowner)
**Senior Head of Household Credit:** N/A (age 43)
**Young Child Tax Credit:** N/A (no dependents)

**Current Status:** Not claiming depreciation (using actual expense method without depreciation)
**Opportunity:**
- Building value (exclude land): ~$600,000 estimated
- Annual depreciation: $600,000 ÷ 39 years = $15,385
- Business portion: $15,385 × 15.2% = **$2,339/year**
- **Tax savings:** $2,339 × 39.3% = **$919/year**
- **10-year benefit:** $9,190 savings - $5,848 recapture = **$3,342 net**
**Consideration:** Depreciation recapture at sale (25% tax rate)
**Recommendation:** Discuss with CPA - may be worth it if holding home 7+ years

### 4. Startup & Organizational Costs (S-Corp)
**If S-Corp was formed recently:**

## Tax Challenges & Considerations

### Late Filing (Filing 2022 Taxes in 2025)

**Penalties:**
- **Failure to file:** 5% per month (max 25%) of unpaid tax
- **Failure to pay:** 0.5% per month (max 25%) of unpaid tax
- **Interest:** IRS interest rate (varies quarterly, ~7-8% in 2023-2025)

**Estimated Penalties (if owed $20,000):**
- Failure to file: $5,000 (25% cap reached after 5 months)
- Failure to pay: ~$3,000 (0.5% × 36 months)
- Interest: ~$4,800 (8% × 3 years × $20,000)
- **Total penalties/interest:** ~$12,800

**Mitigation:**
- File as soon as possible to stop penalties
- Apply for penalty abatement (first-time penalty abatement if eligible)
- Set up payment plan if can't pay in full

### SALT Cap Impact (Major Issue for CA Residents)

**The Problem:**
- Paid $28,695+ in state/local taxes (state income + property tax)
- Federal deduction limited to $10,000
- **Lost deduction:** $18,695+ (can't deduct on federal return)

**No Easy Workaround:**
- SALT cap applies to individuals (not businesses)
- S-Corp can't pay individual's state income tax (PTET workaround N/A in CA for 2022)
- Property tax prepayment doesn't help (already limited to $10k)

**Silver Lining:**
- California has no SALT cap on state return
- Full $3,095 property tax deductible on CA return

### Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) Risk

**Profile:**
- High income (~$230,000)
- High state income tax (~$25,600)
- Significant itemized deductions ($30,347)

**AMT Considerations:**
- SALT deduction disallowed for AMT (add back $10,000)
- Mortgage interest allowed for AMT (qualified housing interest)
- May trigger AMT if AMT income exceeds exemption

**Action needed:** Calculate AMT liability (Form 6251)

### Self-Employment Tax on S-Corp Income

**If Popstand Income = S-Corp:**
- S-Corp owners should pay themselves reasonable W-2 wages
- Remaining profit distributed as dividends (no SE tax)
- **Issue:** If $130,500 Popstand income was all distributions (no W-2), IRS may reclassify

**Action needed:**
- Verify how Popstand income was reported (W-2 vs. K-1)
- Ensure S-Corp paid reasonable wages if distributions were taken

### Passive Activity Loss Limitations (If Applicable)

**If S-Corp has losses:**
- Passive loss rules may limit deductibility
- Material participation test (500+ hours)
- At-risk rules

**Action needed:** If S-Corp shows loss on K-1, verify material participation

### Home Office Deduction - IRS Audit Risk

**Audit Triggers:**
- Home office deduction (Schedule C or Form 8829)
- High deduction relative to income

**Mitigation:**
- Document exclusive use (photos, floor plan)
- Regular use (logs, calendar entries)
- Principal place of business (home is admin center)
- Keep excellent records

### Loan Transaction Reporting

**$25,000 Loan Disbursed:**
- Not an expense (it's a loan asset)
- NOT reported on tax return (no Form 1099 issued for loan)
- Interest received (if any) = taxable income

**$10,000 Loan Repayment Received:**
- Not income (return of principal)
- NOT reported on tax return

**Only report:**
- Interest income received (if loan charged interest)
- Bad debt deduction (if loan defaults)
