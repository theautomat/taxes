## Tax Implications

### If Withdrawn (Cash Out)
- **Taxable as ordinary income** in the year of withdrawal
- **10% early withdrawal penalty** if under age 59Â½
- **Total tax hit:** ~45-55% (federal income tax + state tax + penalty)
- **Estimated taxes on $27,170.59:** ~$12,000-$15,000

**Not recommended** due to high tax cost

---

## Rollover Option (Tax-Free)

### Direct Rollover to IRA
- **No taxes** if rolled directly to Traditional IRA
- **No penalties**
- Money continues to grow tax-deferred
- More investment options than 401(k)
- **Recommended approach**

### Rollover Process
1. Open Traditional IRA (Fidelity, Vanguard, Schwab, etc.)
2. Request direct rollover from ForUsAll to new IRA
3. ForUsAll sends check directly to new IRA custodian
4. No taxes or penalties

## Form 1099-R

**Expected:** A Form 1099-R should have been issued for the April 2025 transfer showing:
- Distribution from ForUsAll
- Transfer/rollover to Penchecks Trust Company
- Code "G" (Direct rollover to IRA or another qualified plan) - if it was a direct rollover
- Or other code if different type of distribution

**Status:** Need to locate 1099-R for 2025 tax year filing

**Note:** If this was a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer, it should be non-taxable and reported with rollover code.

## Action Items

- [ ] Contact Penchecks Trust Company (800-541-3938) to verify current balance
- [ ] Locate 2025 Form 1099-R from ForUsAll or Penchecks
- [ ] Verify transfer was direct rollover (non-taxable)
- [ ] Decide on future: keep with Penchecks or rollover to preferred IRA provider
- [ ] Keep for retirement or use for current tax year expenses (if needed)

## Notes

- This 401(k) is likely from prior employment (NFT Genius or earlier)
- Balance is pre-tax money (was deducted from income when contributed)
- Cannot be used to reduce 2022 tax liability (already in the account)
- Transfer in April 2025 does not affect 2022 taxes
- Could be relevant for future retirement planning
- Difference between original balance ($27,170.59) and transferred amount ($26,816.00) = $354.59 - possibly fees or market changes
