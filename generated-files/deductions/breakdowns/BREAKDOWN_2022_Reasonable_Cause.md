## What is Reasonable Cause?

Reasonable Cause is an IRS penalty relief option when you can demonstrate you exercised ordinary business care and prudence but were still unable to comply with tax obligations due to circumstances beyond your control. Unlike First Time Abatement, this requires detailed explanation and documentation.

**When you might need this:** If First Time Abatement doesn't apply, or for penalties FTA doesn't cover (like accuracy-related penalties from income reconciliation issues).

## Common Reasonable Cause Examples

**Generally accepted by IRS:**
- Death, serious illness, or unavoidable absence
- Fire, casualty, natural disaster, or civil disturbance
- Unable to obtain records
- Erroneous advice from IRS or tax professional
- System failures beyond your control

**Related to your situation:**
- Missing or incomplete income records requiring extensive reconstruction
- Multiple income sources creating reconciliation complexity
- Records lost or destroyed requiring time to rebuild
