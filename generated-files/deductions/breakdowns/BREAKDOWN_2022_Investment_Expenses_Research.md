## What Are Investment Expenses?

Investment expenses are costs you incur to **produce or collect taxable investment income** or to **manage property held for investment**. Unlike business expenses (which reduce business income), investment expenses are claimed on Schedule A as miscellaneous itemized deductions.

**Common examples:**
- Investment advisory fees
- Safe deposit box rental
- Subscriptions to investment publications (Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg Terminal, etc.)
- Software used to track investments or manage portfolio
- Fees to accountants/attorneys for investment advice
- Online research services for investment decisions

---

## Why This Might Apply to Your Situation

Some of your software subscriptions and services might qualify as **investment-related** rather than business-related if they were used for:
- Cryptocurrency research and portfolio tracking
- NFT market analysis tools
- Financial data services
- Investment research platforms
- Tax software for calculating investment gains/losses

**Key distinction:**
- **Business expense:** Software used to develop products, create NFTs, build applications
- **Investment expense:** Software used to research, track, or manage your personal crypto/NFT investments

## The 2022 Tax Law Limitation

**IMPORTANT:** For tax years 2018-2025, investment expenses that are "miscellaneous itemized deductions subject to 2% AGI floor" are **NOT deductible** due to Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

**However**, certain investment expenses may still be deductible:
- Investment interest expense (Schedule A, Line 9)
- Expenses directly related to production of royalty/rental income

---

## Action Required

**Research needed to determine:**
1. Which of your software subscriptions could be reclassified as investment expenses
2. Whether any fall into the still-deductible categories
3. If maintaining detailed records for future years (post-2025) would be beneficial

**Estimated potential:** Low for 2022 due to current law limitations, but worth documenting for future years.
