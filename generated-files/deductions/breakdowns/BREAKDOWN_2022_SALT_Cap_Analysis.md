# 2022 SALT Cap Analysis
**Understanding the $10,000 State and Local Tax Deduction Limit**
**Analysis Date:** 2025-10-18

## What is the SALT Cap?

**SALT = State And Local Taxes**

The SALT cap is a **$10,000 federal limit** on the total amount of state and local taxes you can deduct on your federal tax return.

**Important Clarifications:**
1. **SALT is NOT the name of a deduction** - it's just IRS shorthand for "Line 5 on Schedule A"
2. **The cap is ONE combined limit** - not separate caps for each type of tax
3. **The limit is $10,000 total** ($5,000 if married filing separately)

---

## What Taxes Are Included in SALT?

**ALL of these count toward the SAME $10,000 cap:**
- State income tax (or state sales tax, you pick one)
- Local income tax (e.g., NYC city tax)
- Property tax (real estate)
- Personal property tax (e.g., car registration fees based on value)

**Think of it like ONE bucket that can only hold $10,000:**
```
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│   SALT BUCKET (Max: $10,000)    │
├──────────────────────────────────┤
│  State Income Tax                │
│  +                               │
│  Property Tax                    │
│  +                               │
│  Local Taxes                     │
│  =                               │
│  Total SALT (capped at $10k)    │
└──────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Your 2022 SALT Situation

### What You Paid

**State Income Tax (CA):**
- NFT Genius W-2 withholding: $23,627.34
- Popstand W-2 withholding: ~$2,000-2,400
- **Total state income tax: ~$25,600-26,000**

**Property Tax:**
- 662 Mountain View Street: $3,095.19

**Total SALT Paid:**
```
State Income Tax:  $25,600
Property Tax:       $3,095
─────────────────────────
Total SALT:        $28,695
```

---

### What You Can Deduct (Federal)

**Schedule A, Line 5:**
```
Line 5a: State income tax        $25,600  ← You enter this
Line 5c: Property tax             $3,095  ← You enter this
─────────────────────────────────────────
Subtotal (before cap):           $28,695

Line 5e: Total SALT (capped):    $10,000  ← IRS limits you to this
─────────────────────────────────────────
Non-deductible (wasted):         $18,695  ← You lose this
```

**Tax Impact:**
- Federal deduction: $10,000
- Tax savings: $10,000 × 24% = $2,400 (assuming 24% bracket)

---

## Why Property Tax Doesn't Help You

This is the confusing part that trips everyone up:

**Your state income tax ALONE ($25,600) already exceeds the $10,000 cap.**

### The Bucket Analogy

Imagine the SALT deduction is a bucket that can only hold $10,000:

```
Step 1: Pour in state income tax ($25,600)
┌────────────────┐
│ OVERFLOWING!   │ ← State income tax
│ $10,000 FULL   │    fills the bucket
│ (cap reached)  │    and overflows
└────────────────┘
   ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓
  $15,600 spills out (wasted)


Step 2: Pour in property tax ($3,095)
┌────────────────┐
│ STILL FULL     │ ← Property tax just
│ $10,000 CAP    │    spills out too
│ (already hit)  │    (provides no benefit)
└────────────────┘
   ↓ ↓ ↓
  $3,095 spills out (wasted)
```

**Bottom Line:**
- The bucket was already full from state income tax alone
- Adding property tax doesn't increase your deduction (bucket can't hold more than $10k)
- Property tax provides **ZERO additional federal benefit**

## The Math Breakdown

### Scenario 1: If You Only Had State Income Tax

```
State Income Tax:  $25,600
Property Tax:           $0
─────────────────────────
Total SALT:        $25,600

Federal Deduction: $10,000 (capped)
```

**Result:** You get $10,000 deduction.

---

### Scenario 2: Actual Situation (State Income + Property Tax)

```
State Income Tax:  $25,600
Property Tax:       $3,095
─────────────────────────
Total SALT:        $28,695

Federal Deduction: $10,000 (capped)
```

**Result:** You STILL get $10,000 deduction.

---

### Comparison

```
Scenario 1 (no property tax):    $10,000 deduction
Scenario 2 (with property tax):  $10,000 deduction
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Difference:                      $0 benefit
```

**Conclusion:** Paying $3,095 in property tax provided **ZERO additional federal tax benefit** because you already hit the cap.

---

## When Would Property Tax Help?

Property tax would help federally ONLY if your total SALT was under $10,000:

### Example: Lower Income Scenario

```
State Income Tax:   $6,000  ← Under cap
Property Tax:       $3,095
─────────────────────────
Total SALT:         $9,095  ← Under $10k cap

Federal Deduction:  $9,095  ← Full deduction (not capped)
```

In this case, property tax would save you: $3,095 × 24% = $743 federally.

**But your actual situation:**
```
State Income Tax:  $25,600  ← WAY over cap
Property Tax:       $3,095
─────────────────────────
Total SALT:        $28,695  ← Way over $10k cap

Federal Deduction: $10,000  ← Capped (lose $18,695)
```

Property tax saves you: **$0 federally** (bucket already full).

## California State Tax Impact

**Good news:** California does NOT have a SALT cap.

**California allows:**
- Full property tax deduction: $3,095 (no cap)
- State income tax: NOT deductible (can't deduct state tax from state tax)

**California tax savings:**
- Property tax: $3,095 × 9.3% = ~$288

**This is the ONLY benefit you get from property tax** - it saves you ~$288 on your California state return.

## SALT Cap History

### Before 2018 (Pre-TCJA)
- **NO SALT cap** - you could deduct unlimited state and local taxes
- If you paid $28,695 in SALT, you deducted $28,695

### 2018-2025 (Current Law - TCJA)
- **$10,000 SALT cap** ($5,000 if married filing separately)
- If you pay $28,695 in SALT, you can only deduct $10,000
- Set to expire December 31, 2025

### After 2025 (If TCJA Expires)
- **NO SALT cap** (reverts to pre-2018 rules)
- If you pay $28,695 in SALT, you deduct $28,695
- Congress may extend TCJA or make changes

**Impact for High-Tax States:**
- California, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts residents hit this cap easily
- High earners with high state income tax get hurt the most
- Property tax becomes federally irrelevant if state income tax alone exceeds $10k

## How to Report SALT on Schedule A

**Step 1: Calculate your SALT components**
```
Line 5a: State income tax     $25,600
Line 5b: State sales tax      $0 (you're using income tax instead)
Line 5c: Property tax         $3,095
Line 5d: Personal property    $0 (e.g., car registration)
────────────────────────────────────
Subtotal:                    $28,695
```

**Step 2: Apply the cap**
```
Line 5e: Total SALT (limited) $10,000  ← ENTER THIS ON YOUR RETURN
```

**Step 3: Attach to Form 1040**
- Transfer Line 5e to your Form 1040
- This becomes part of your total itemized deductions

## Common SALT Cap Misconceptions

### ❌ Misconception 1: "I get $10k for property tax AND $10k for income tax"
**Reality:** ONE $10k cap total for BOTH combined.

### ❌ Misconception 2: "SALT is a specific deduction I claim"
**Reality:** SALT is just shorthand for "Line 5 on Schedule A" - the deduction is called "Itemized Deductions"

### ❌ Misconception 3: "If I pay property tax, I get to deduct it"
**Reality:** You can only deduct up to $10k TOTAL SALT. If income tax already hit the cap, property tax doesn't help.

### ❌ Misconception 4: "The SALT cap applies per tax type"
**Reality:** It's ONE combined limit for all state and local taxes together.

### ✅ Correct Understanding:
- Schedule A is the deduction (Itemized Deductions)
- SALT is one line item (Line 5) within Schedule A
- SALT has a $10k cap that applies to ALL state/local taxes combined
- Property tax only helps if your total SALT is under $10k

## Summary

**What is SALT?**
- SALT = State And Local Taxes
- It's Line 5 on Schedule A (not a separate deduction name)
- Includes: state income tax + property tax + local taxes (combined)

**The $10,000 Cap:**
- ONE limit for ALL SALT combined
- If you exceed $10k, the excess is non-deductible

**Your 2022 Situation:**
```
State Income Tax:  $25,600  ← Already exceeds cap by $15,600
Property Tax:       $3,095  ← Provides ZERO federal benefit
─────────────────────────
Total SALT:        $28,695
Federal Deduction: $10,000  ← Capped (lose $18,695)

Federal Savings:   $10,000 × 24% = $2,400
CA Savings:         $3,095 × 9.3% = $288
```

**Why Property Tax Doesn't Help (Federally):**
- Your state income tax alone exceeds the $10k cap
- The "SALT bucket" is already full
- Property tax just spills out (non-deductible)
- Only benefit: ~$288 savings on California return
