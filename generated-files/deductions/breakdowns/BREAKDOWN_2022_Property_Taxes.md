## Tax Deduction Rules

### Federal (IRS)

**SALT Cap Limitation:**
- State And Local Tax (SALT) deduction is capped at **$10,000** ($5,000 if married filing separately)
- This cap includes:
  - Property taxes (real estate)
  - State income taxes (or state sales taxes if you elect that)
  - Local taxes

**Your Property Taxes:**
- Property taxes paid: $3,095.19
- This counts toward your $10,000 SALT cap

**Typical Scenario:**
- Property taxes: $3,095.19
- CA state income taxes: ~$6,904.81 (to reach $10k cap)
- **Total SALT deduction on federal Schedule A: $10,000** (capped)

### California (Franchise Tax Board)

**NO CAP on property taxes:**
- California does NOT apply the $10,000 SALT cap
- You can deduct the **full $3,095.19** on your California return
- State income taxes are not deductible on state return (you can't deduct state taxes from state taxes)

## How to Claim This Deduction

### Federal Return

**Schedule A (Form 1040), Line 5:**
- **Line 5a:** State and local income taxes
- **Line 5b:** State and local general sales taxes (OR income taxes, choose one)
- **Line 5c:** State and local real estate taxes = **$3,095.19**
- **Line 5d:** State and local personal property taxes
- **Line 5e:** Add lines 5a-5d, BUT limited to $10,000 total

**Example:**
```
Line 5a (CA income tax):      $8,000
Line 5c (property tax):       $3,095
Subtotal:                    $11,095
Line 5e (after SALT cap):    $10,000  ← Limited
```

### California Return

**Schedule CA (540), Part II:**
- Property taxes: **$3,095.19** (full amount, no cap)
- Adjust federal itemized deductions to remove SALT cap

## Allocation (If Claiming Home Office)

**If you claim a home office deduction:**
- Split property taxes between business and personal use
- Business percentage: Based on square footage of home office
- Personal percentage: Remaining amount

**Example (15.2% business use):**
- Business portion (Schedule C via Form 8829): $3,095.19 × 15.2% = $470.48
- Personal portion (Schedule A): $3,095.19 × 84.8% = $2,624.71

**See:** `BREAKDOWN_2022_Home_Office.md` for home office allocation details

---

## Escrow Account

Your property taxes were paid from your mortgage escrow account:

**2022 Escrow Activity:**
- Deposits: $1,168.37 × 10 months = $11,683.70 (portion for taxes)
- Disbursements (taxes): $3,095.19
- Remaining in escrow: Available for 2023 property tax bills

**Note:** The fact that taxes were paid from escrow doesn't change the deduction - you still paid them (via your mortgage payment), so you can deduct them.

## California Property Tax System

**Tax Year vs. Fiscal Year:**
- California property taxes are paid in arrears
- The 2021-2022 fiscal year tax is paid in two installments:
  - 1st installment: Due November 1, 2021 (delinquent after December 10)
  - 2nd installment: Due February 1, 2022 (delinquent after April 10)

**Your 2022 Payments:**
- March 31: Likely 2nd installment for 2021-2022 fiscal year
- November 29: Likely 1st installment for 2022-2023 fiscal year

**For Tax Purposes:**
- You deduct property taxes in the year PAID (cash basis)
- 2022 tax return: Deduct what was paid in calendar year 2022 = $3,095.19
