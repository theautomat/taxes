# 2022 Property Tax Deduction
**Property:** 662 Mountain View Street, Fillmore CA 93015
**County:** Ventura County, California
**Analysis Date:** 2025-10-18

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: This Deduction is Likely IRRELEVANT for Federal Taxes

**TL;DR:** You already hit the $10,000 SALT cap from state income tax alone. Property taxes don't help federally.

### Your 2022 Situation

**CA State Income Tax Withheld:**
- NFT Genius: **$23,627.34** (from paystubs)
- Popstand: **~$2,000-2,400** (estimated from 12 payroll payments)
- **Total CA State Tax:** **~$25,600-26,000**

**Property Taxes Paid:**
- 662 Mountain View: **$3,095.19**

**SALT Cap Reality:**
```
CA State Income Tax:   $25,600+
Property Tax:           $3,095
───────────────────────────────
Total SALT:           $28,695+

Federal SALT Cap:     $10,000  ← YOU'RE CAPPED!
Excess (wasted):      $18,695+
```

**What This Means:**
- **Federal:** Property tax deduction is **WORTHLESS** - you already exceeded the $10k cap by $15,600+ from state income tax alone
- **California:** Property tax IS deductible (no cap) - saves ~$288 at 9.3% rate

**Bottom Line:** For federal purposes, whether you paid $0 or $100,000 in property tax makes zero difference. You hit the SALT cap from state income tax alone.

## Tax Deduction Rules

### Federal (IRS)

**SALT Cap Limitation:**
- State And Local Tax (SALT) deduction is capped at **$10,000** ($5,000 if married filing separately)
- This cap includes:
  - Property taxes (real estate)
  - State income taxes (or state sales taxes if you elect that)
  - Local taxes

**Your ACTUAL 2022 Numbers:**
```
CA State Income Tax Withheld:    $25,600+
Property Taxes Paid:              $3,095
────────────────────────────────────────
Total SALT:                      $28,695+
Federal SALT Deduction Allowed:  $10,000  ← CAPPED
Amount You LOSE:                 $18,695+
```

**Reality Check:**
- You paid $28,695+ in state and local taxes
- IRS only lets you deduct $10,000
- You "waste" $18,695+ that you can't deduct
- Property tax is part of that wasted amount - it provides **ZERO additional federal benefit**

### California (Franchise Tax Board)

**NO CAP on property taxes:**
- California does NOT apply the $10,000 SALT cap
- You can deduct the **full $3,095.19** on your California return
- State income taxes are not deductible on state return (you can't deduct state taxes from state taxes)

---

## How to Claim This Deduction

### Federal Return

**Schedule A (Form 1040), Line 5:**
- **Line 5a:** State and local income taxes
- **Line 5b:** State and local general sales taxes (OR income taxes, choose one)
- **Line 5c:** State and local real estate taxes = **$3,095.19**
- **Line 5d:** State and local personal property taxes
- **Line 5e:** Add lines 5a-5d, BUT limited to $10,000 total

**Your ACTUAL 2022 Filing:**
```
Line 5a (CA income tax):     $25,600+
Line 5c (property tax):       $3,095
Subtotal:                    $28,695+
Line 5e (after SALT cap):    $10,000  ← CAPPED - you lose $18,695+
```

**What this means:** The property tax doesn't help at all federally because you already exceeded the cap with state income tax alone.

### California Return

**Schedule CA (540), Part II:**
- Property taxes: **$3,095.19** (full amount, no cap)
- Adjust federal itemized deductions to remove SALT cap

## Allocation (If Claiming Home Office)

**If you claim a home office deduction:**
- Split property taxes between business and personal use
- Business percentage: Based on square footage of home office
- Personal percentage: Remaining amount

**Example (15.2% business use):**
- Business portion (Schedule C via Form 8829): $3,095.19 × 15.2% = $470.48
- Personal portion (Schedule A): $3,095.19 × 84.8% = $2,624.71

**See:** `BREAKDOWN_2022_Home_Office.md` for home office allocation details

---

## Escrow Account

Your property taxes were paid from your mortgage escrow account:

**2022 Escrow Activity:**
- Deposits: $1,168.37 × 10 months = $11,683.70 (portion for taxes)
- Disbursements (taxes): $3,095.19
- Remaining in escrow: Available for 2023 property tax bills

**Note:** The fact that taxes were paid from escrow doesn't change the deduction - you still paid them (via your mortgage payment), so you can deduct them.

## California Property Tax System

**Tax Year vs. Fiscal Year:**
- California property taxes are paid in arrears
- The 2021-2022 fiscal year tax is paid in two installments:
  - 1st installment: Due November 1, 2021 (delinquent after December 10)
  - 2nd installment: Due February 1, 2022 (delinquent after April 10)

**Your 2022 Payments:**
- March 31: Likely 2nd installment for 2021-2022 fiscal year
- November 29: Likely 1st installment for 2022-2023 fiscal year

**For Tax Purposes:**
- You deduct property taxes in the year PAID (cash basis)
- 2022 tax return: Deduct what was paid in calendar year 2022 = $3,095.19

---

## Tax Forms Required

## Summary

**2022 Property Taxes Paid:** $3,095.19

**Federal Tax Impact:** **$0 savings** (ZERO)
- You already exceeded the $10k SALT cap by $15,600+ from state income tax alone
- Property tax provides **NO additional federal benefit**
- Report it on Schedule A Line 5c for completeness, but it's mathematically irrelevant

**California Tax Impact:** **~$288 savings**
- Full $3,095.19 deductible (no cap)
- $3,095.19 × 9.3% = ~$288 tax savings

**The Brutal Truth:**
```
What you paid in SALT:           $28,695+
What IRS lets you deduct:        $10,000
What you can't deduct (wasted):  $18,695+

Property tax ($3,095) is buried in that wasted $18,695.
```

**How to Claim:**
- **Federal:** Report on Schedule A, Line 5c (but it won't help - you're already capped)
- **California:** Full deduction on Schedule CA (this DOES help - saves ~$288)
