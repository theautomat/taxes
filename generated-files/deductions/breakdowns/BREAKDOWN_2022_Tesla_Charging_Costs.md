## Tax Treatment & Deductibility

### IRS Rules for Vehicle Charging Costs

**Business vehicle expenses are deductible, including:**
- Electricity costs for charging at commercial charging stations (Tesla Superchargers)
- Charging costs during business travel
- Charging costs for commuting between home office and temporary work location

**Methods for Deducting Vehicle Expenses:**

1. **Standard Mileage Rate** (2022 rates):
   - Jan-Jun 2022: $0.585/mile
   - Jul-Dec 2022: $0.625/mile
   - **Includes estimated fuel/electricity costs**
   - **Cannot separately deduct charging costs if using this method**

2. **Actual Expense Method**:
   - Deduct actual costs (charging, maintenance, insurance, etc.)
   - Apply business use percentage
   - **Can deduct actual charging costs**
   - Must keep detailed records

### Your Situation

**Challenge:** You likely need to choose ONE method for all 2022 vehicle expenses:

**Option A: Standard Mileage Rate**
- Calculate business miles driven (Fillmore ↔ Pasadena: ~150 miles round trip × number of trips)
- Use standard mileage rate ($0.585 or $0.625/mile depending on month)
- **Cannot claim Supercharger costs separately** (already included in mileage rate)

**Option B: Actual Expense Method**
- Track ALL vehicle expenses (charging, gas, maintenance, insurance, registration, depreciation)
- Calculate business use percentage
- Deduct business portion of ALL expenses
- **Can claim $216.23 in business Supercharger costs**
- Must have records for all other vehicle expenses

### Recommendation

**If you have a detailed mileage log** showing Fillmore ↔ Pasadena trips:
- Standard mileage rate will likely yield a MUCH larger deduction
- Example: 20 round trips × 150 miles × $0.60/mile = $1,800
- This already includes fuel/electricity, so don't double-dip with charging costs

**If you don't have a mileage log:**
- Actual expense method allows you to claim $216.23 in Supercharger costs
- But you'd need records of ALL vehicle expenses to maximize this method
- Consider if you have insurance, registration, maintenance records

**Most Conservative Approach:**
- Use standard mileage rate for Pasadena office commuting (if you have trip logs)
- Claim Las Vegas charging separately as business travel expense ($65.37)
- Las Vegas trip was fully reimbursed, so may not provide additional benefit

## Home Charging (Not Included in Analysis)

You mentioned charging at home, but home charging costs are **much harder to deduct**:

**Why home charging is difficult:**
- IRS requires you to prove the business portion of your electric bill
- Need to show kWh used for vehicle vs. household
- Complex calculation: vehicle efficiency (kWh/mile) × business miles × electricity rate
- Often not worth the complexity unless you have:
  - Separate meter for EV charger
  - Detailed mileage and charging logs
  - High business use percentage (>50%)

**Recommendation:** Skip home charging deduction unless:
1. You have a separate meter/circuit for the Tesla charger
2. You can prove business use percentage (>50%)
3. The deduction is worth the audit risk and documentation burden

For most taxpayers, standard mileage rate (which includes estimated electricity) is simpler and more beneficial.

## Documentation Requirements

### What You Have ✅
- Tesla charging history CSV (all 2022 Supercharger transactions)
- NFT Genius reimbursement records (Vegas trip: $1,362.87)
- Office rent payment records (Pasadena office: Oct-Dec 2022)

### What You Need ⚠️
- **Mileage log** showing:
  - Date of each trip
  - Starting location (Fillmore home)
  - Destination (Pasadena office)
  - Miles driven
  - Business purpose
- **Alternative:** Calendar entries showing Pasadena office visits
- **Alternative:** Email confirmations of meetings/work sessions in Pasadena

### For Audit Defense
- Keep Tesla charging history CSV
- Keep NFT Genius paystubs showing office rent reimbursement
- Keep any calendar invites, meeting notes, or emails referencing Pasadena office
- Document business purpose for Aug-Sept Pasadena charges (pre-rental period)

## Calculation Summary

### Deductible Business Charging

| Category | Amount | Tax Savings (45.3%) |
|----------|--------|---------------------|
| Pasadena Office Charging | $150.86 | $68.34 |
| Las Vegas Business Trip | $65.37 | $29.61 |
| **Total Business Charging** | **$216.23** | **$97.95** |

### BUT CONSIDER: Mileage Deduction Alternative

**If you have a mileage log for Pasadena trips:**

Estimated scenario (conservative):
- 15 round trips to Pasadena office (Oct-Dec 2022)
- 150 miles per round trip = 2,250 miles
- Standard mileage rate: $0.625/mile (Jul-Dec rate)
- **Mileage deduction: 2,250 × $0.625 = $1,406.25**
- **Tax savings: $1,406.25 × 45.3% = $637.03**

**Compare:**
- Actual charging deduction: $216.23 → saves $97.95
- Standard mileage deduction: $1,406.25 → saves $637.03
- **Mileage method saves an additional $539.08!**

**Recommendation:** Reconstruct your Pasadena office visit dates from:
- Calendar entries
- Email timestamps (sent from Pasadena office)
- Credit card charges near Pasadena office
- Parking receipts
Then use standard mileage rate instead of actual charging costs.

## Next Steps

1. ⚠️ **Determine which method to use:**
   - Do you have a mileage log or can you reconstruct one? → Use standard mileage rate
   - No mileage records? → Use actual expense method (charging + other vehicle costs)

2. ⚠️ **If using standard mileage:**
   - Reconstruct Pasadena office visit dates (Oct-Dec 2022)
   - Calculate miles: Fillmore to Pasadena and back (~150 miles round trip)
   - Apply standard mileage rate ($0.625/mile for Oct-Dec 2022)
   - DO NOT separately claim Supercharger costs (double-dipping not allowed)

3. ⚠️ **If using actual expense:**
   - Gather ALL 2022 vehicle expenses (insurance, registration, maintenance, gas, repairs)
   - Calculate business use percentage
   - Apply to all expenses including $216.23 in Supercharger costs

4. ⚠️ **Las Vegas trip:**
   - Already reimbursed by NFT Genius ($1,362.87)
   - Reimbursement was tax-free (accountable plan)
   - Charging costs ($65.37) were part of reimbursed expenses
   - **No additional deduction available** (already compensated)

5. ✅ **Accountant discussion:**
   - Bring Tesla charging history CSV
   - Discuss whether standard mileage or actual expense method is better
   - Ask about reconstructing mileage log from calendar/emails
   - Confirm Las Vegas reimbursement treatment
