## Key Finding: Pasadena Office Actually HELPS Your Home Office Deduction

**Your Situation:**
- Home office in Fillmore (225 sq ft)
- Company-rented office space in Pasadena (reimbursed by company)
- Split time between both locations

**Good News:**
1. **Reimbursed office rent is NOT taxable income** (accountable plan)
2. **Home office STILL qualifies** under IRS "administrative or management activities" test
3. **You can claim BOTH:**
   - Reimbursements for Pasadena office (not taxable)
   - Home office deduction (tax deductible)

**IRS Rule:** Home qualifies as principal place of business if you use it for substantial administrative/management activities, **even if you also conduct business at another location**.

## Your Three Deduction Options

### Option 1: Simplified Method
**Deduction:** $1,500
**Calculation:** 300 sq ft × $5/sq ft (CAPPED at 300 sq ft max, actual office is 704 sq ft)

**Tax Savings:**
- $1,500 × 45.3% (35% federal + 9.3% CA + 0.9% Medicare) = **$679/year**

**Pros:**
- Super simple
- No depreciation recapture
- Minimal documentation

**Cons:**
- Smallest deduction
- **Severely limited by 300 sq ft cap** (you have 704 sq ft office!)

## Pasadena Office Rent Reimbursements

**Tax Treatment:**
- **Reimbursements: NOT taxable income** (under accountable plan rules)
- **You don't report as income**
- **Company deducts as business expense**
- **This is SEPARATE from your home office deduction**

**Requirements for accountable plan:**
1. ✓ Business connection (office space for work)
2. ✓ Adequate accounting (receipts/invoices submitted)
3. ✓ Return excess (no excess reimbursements to return)

**Action Required:**
- Verify these reimbursement transactions are NOT included in income
- Document with lease agreements, rent receipts, parking receipts
- Keep separate from home office calculation

**Important:** These reimbursements DO NOT reduce or affect your home office deduction.

## IRS Qualification - You're in Good Shape

**Principal Place of Business Test:**

Your home office qualifies because:
1. **Administrative/Management Activities:** Even though you also work in Pasadena, if you use your home office for:
   - Client communications
   - Administrative tasks
   - Planning and management
   - Coding and development work

2. **Exclusive Use:** 225 sq ft room used exclusively for business

3. **Regular Use:** Used consistently throughout 2022

**IRS specifically allows home office even when you have another workplace.**

From IRS Pub 587:
> "If you use your home office for administrative or management activities and have no other fixed location where you conduct these activities, your home office qualifies as your principal place of business."

## Recommendations

### My Recommendation: **Option 2 (Actual Expenses WITHOUT Depreciation)**

**Why:**
1. **Best ROI:** 8.4× better than simplified method
2. **No recapture risk:** Clean exit when you sell
3. **Reasonable complexity:** Track utilities and insurance, you're already tracking mortgage/taxes
4. **Strong qualification:** Home clearly used for admin/management (requires excellent documentation for 47.6% business use)

**Your 2022 Tax Savings:**
- Minimum (just mortgage + taxes): **$5,068**
- With utilities/insurance: **~$5,715**
- **vs. $679 with simplified method**
- **Extra savings: $4,389-$5,036/year**

### If You Want Maximum Deduction: **Option 3 (With Depreciation)**

**Extra annual savings:** ~$3,318-$3,671/year over Option 2
**10-year net benefit after recapture:** ~$14,872-$17,402 more

**Worth it if:**
- You're staying in home 7+ years
- You want maximum current deductions
- You accept recapture obligation
- You have exceptional documentation for the large business use percentage

## Important Reminders

1. **Pasadena office reimbursements are GOOD:**
   - Not taxable income
   - Don't reduce home office deduction
   - Keep documentation separate

2. **Dual workspace is ALLOWED:**
   - IRS permits home office + another workplace
   - As long as home is where admin/management happens
   - No percentage-of-time calculation needed

3. **Exclusive use is REQUIRED:**
   - 225 sq ft room must be business only
   - Cannot be guest room/office combo
   - Regular, continuous business use

4. **Documentation is key:**
   - Photos of office setup
   - All home expense receipts
   - Measurements and floor plan
   - Description of business activities conducted there

## Final Numbers

**Your Home Office:**
- **Size:** 704 sq ft (32' × 22' room)
- **Percentage:** 47.6% of 1,480 sq ft home
- **2022 Deduction (recommended):** $11,189-$12,617
- **Tax Savings:** $5,068-$5,715
- **10-Year Benefit:** $50,680-$57,150 (no recapture)

**This is HIGHLY worth pursuing.** The $5,000-$5,700 per year in tax savings is substantial. However, 47.6% business use is high and requires excellent documentation to support exclusive business use claim.
