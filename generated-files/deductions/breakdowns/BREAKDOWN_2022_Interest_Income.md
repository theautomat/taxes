## What is Form 1099-INT?

- **Tax Year:** 2022

## How Mortgage Escrow Interest Works

### What is an Escrow Account?

When you make your monthly mortgage payment, a portion goes into an **escrow account**:
- **Your monthly escrow deposit:** $1,168.37 (included in mortgage payment)
- **Purpose:** PHH holds this money to pay your property taxes and insurance when due
- **Benefit to you:** The money sitting in escrow earns interest

### 2022 Escrow Account Activity

From your Form 1098 mortgage statement (see `BREAKDOWN_2022_Mortgage_Interest.md` for full details):

**Escrow Account Summary:**
- **Beginning Balance (Jan 2022):** $0.00
- **Deposits (2022):** $18,560.51
  - Initial deposit: $6,673.36
  - Monthly deposits: $1,168.37 × 10 payments = $11,683.70
  - **Interest earned:** $203.45 ← This is your 1099-INT amount
- **Disbursements:** $3,982.69
  - Property taxes paid: $3,095.19
  - PMI paid: $887.50
- **Ending Balance (Dec 2022):** $14,577.82

### Why You Owe Tax on This

Even though:
- ✓ The money was held by PHH (not in your personal account)
- ✓ The money was used to pay your property taxes and insurance
- ✓ You never "received" this interest in cash

**IRS Rule:** Interest earned on escrow accounts belongs to you and is taxable income.

**Result:** You must report $203.45 as interest income on your 2022 tax return.

## Tax Impact

### How Much Tax Will You Owe?

**Interest Income:** $203.45

**Federal Tax:**
- Tax rate (assumed 24% bracket): $203.45 × 24% = **$48.83**

**California State Tax:**
- Tax rate (assumed 9.3% bracket): $203.45 × 9.3% = **$18.92**

**Total Additional Tax:** $48.83 + $18.92 = **~$67.75**

**Note:** This is additional income tax. It's not subject to self-employment tax since it's investment income, not business income.

## How to Report This on Your Tax Return

### Federal Return

**Form 1040, Line 2b:**
- This is where you report total taxable interest

**Schedule B (Interest and Ordinary Dividends):**
- **Part I - Interest**
- **Line 1:** List each payer and amount
  - PHH Mortgage Corporation: $203.45
- **Line 2:** Add lines and enter total on Form 1040, Line 2b

**Example Schedule B (simplified):**
```
Part I - Interest
Line 1:
  Payer: PHH Mortgage Corporation
  Amount: $203.45

  Payer: [Any other banks/interest sources]
  Amount: [Other interest]

Line 2: Total interest = $203.45 + [other] → Enter on Form 1040, Line 2b
```

### California Return

**Form 540, Line 13:**
- Interest income
- **Amount:** Same as federal: $203.45 (included in total interest)

**Note:** California taxes interest income the same as federal - no special adjustments needed for escrow interest.

---

## Important: PHH Already Reported This to the IRS

**Form 1099-INT is an information return:**
- ✓ PHH sent a copy to the IRS
- ✓ IRS expects to see $203.45 interest income on your return
- ✗ **Do NOT skip reporting this** - IRS will notice and may send a CP2000 notice (underreported income)

**Even though the amount is small ($203.45), you must report it.**

---

## Filing Late (2022 Return)

Since you're filing your 2022 return late in 2025:

**Good news:**
- Form 1099-INT is still valid (no expiration)
- The IRS already has this form from PHH (dated 01/11/23)
- You just need to include it on Schedule B

**What to do:**
1. Report $203.45 on Schedule B (Interest Income)
2. Carry total to Form 1040, Line 2b
3. Pay the additional ~$67.75 in tax (included in your total tax liability)

**Late filing penalties:**
- Penalties are based on unpaid tax balance (0.5% per month)
- This small amount of interest income won't significantly affect penalties
- More important: Reporting it avoids IRS notices for underreported income

---

## Other Interest Income to Report

**Don't forget to include ALL interest income sources on Schedule B:**
- Bank accounts (Wells Fargo, etc.)
- Savings accounts
- Money market accounts
- CDs (certificates of deposit)
- Investment accounts
- **This escrow interest: $203.45**

**Threshold for Schedule B:**
- If total interest income > $1,500: Must file Schedule B with details
- If total interest income ≤ $1,500: Can report directly on Form 1040, Line 2b

**Your situation:**
- Escrow interest: $203.45
- Other interest (bank accounts, etc.): [Check your other 1099-INT forms]
- **If total > $1,500:** File Schedule B with itemized list
- **If total ≤ $1,500:** Can report total on Form 1040, Line 2b (but Schedule B still recommended for documentation)

## Comparison: Interest Paid vs. Interest Earned (Form 1098 vs. Form 1099-INT)

It's easy to confuse these two forms from the same lender:

| Form | Type | Amount | Tax Effect | Where to Report |
|------|------|--------|------------|-----------------|
| **Form 1098** | Mortgage Interest **PAID** | $20,410.43 | **Deduction** (reduces tax) | Schedule A, Line 8a |
| **Form 1099-INT** | Escrow Interest **EARNED** | $203.45 | **Income** (increases tax) | Schedule B → Form 1040, Line 2b |

**Net Effect from PHH Mortgage:**
- Mortgage interest deduction: -$20,410.43 (saves ~$6,775 in taxes)
- Escrow interest income: +$203.45 (costs ~$68 in taxes)
- **Net benefit:** ~$6,707 tax savings

**Think of it this way:**
- Form 1098: Money you paid to PHH (deductible)
- Form 1099-INT: Money PHH paid to you (taxable)

## Common Questions

### Q: Can I offset this interest income with the mortgage interest deduction?

**A:** No, they're reported in different places:
- Interest income: Form 1040, Line 2b (always taxable)
- Mortgage interest: Schedule A, Line 8a (only deductible if you itemize)

However, they do indirectly offset:
- Mortgage interest deduction: Reduces taxable income by $20,410.43 → saves ~$6,775
- Escrow interest income: Increases taxable income by $203.45 → costs ~$68
- **Net:** You're still saving ~$6,707 in taxes overall

### Q: Is this the same as "points" or "loan origination fees"?

**A:** No, completely different:
- **Form 1099-INT:** Interest PHH paid TO you (escrow account earnings)
- **Points/fees:** Interest YOU paid to PHH (potentially deductible, but reported on Form 1098, not 1099-INT)

### Q: Do I have to report this if it's less than $10?

**A:** IRS rules:
- Payers must issue 1099-INT if interest ≥ $10
- If you received a 1099-INT, you must report it (regardless of amount)
- Your amount ($203.45) is well above $10 threshold
- **Yes, you must report it**

### Q: What if I didn't receive Form 1099-INT?

**A:**
- Check mail (PHH sent it in January 2023)
- Check online (PHH website/customer portal)
- Call PHH: 1-800-449-8767
- Even if you didn't receive it, **you still must report the income** (PHH sent a copy to the IRS)

### Q: Can I deduct property taxes paid from escrow against this interest income?

**A:** No, these are separate:
- **Interest income ($203.45):** Reported on Schedule B (taxable income)
- **Property taxes ($3,095.19):** Reported on Schedule A (itemized deduction, subject to SALT cap)
- Both get reported, but in different places on your return
