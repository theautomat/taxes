# 2022 Potential Deductions Checklist

## Purpose

## How to Use This Document
1. **Add freely** - Braindump any potential deduction idea (even if uncertain)
2. **Research** - Investigate each item to determine if it qualifies
3. **Check off** - Mark as complete and add inline notes:
   - **Amount** - If deductible (e.g., "**$2,500** - MacBook Pro purchase")
   - **Not applicable** - If doesn't qualify (e.g., "**N/A** - Purchased in 2021, not 2022")
   - **Not deductible** - If personal use (e.g., "**NOT DEDUCTIBLE** - 100% personal")
   - **Needs info** - If more research needed (e.g., "Need to verify business use %")

## Status Conventions
- `[ ]` Unchecked - Not yet researched
- `[x]` Checked + **$amount** - Qualifies, deduction amount known
- `[x]` Checked + **N/A** or **NOT DEDUCTIBLE** - Doesn't qualify (with reason)

## Notes & Questions

### Important: Loan Transactions (Not Income/Expense)
**Legal Loan 2022:**
- **$25,000** loaned out for legal expenses in 2022
- **$10,000** repayment received in 2022
- **Tax Treatment:** Neither the loan nor the repayment are deductible expenses or taxable income
- **IRS Perspective:**
  - Loan disbursement: Not an expense (it's a loan asset)
  - Loan repayment: Not income (it's return of principal)
- **Documentation:** Keep loan agreement and repayment records for audit trail
- **Net Effect:** $15,000 outstanding loan balance at end of 2022 (asset, not expense)
- **Note:** If interest was charged/received, that interest WOULD be taxable income

### Important: Office Reimbursements (Not Income) ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Pasadena Office Reimbursements:**
- **Work Setup:** Part-time home office + part-time Pasadena office in 2022
- **Reimbursements:** Office rent reimbursed by NFT Genius (employer)
- **Tax Treatment:** Reimbursements are NOT taxable income (accountable plan)

**VERIFIED REIMBURSEMENTS (from Gusto payroll stubs):**
- **October 31, 2022:** $3,200.00 - Office Rent Reimbursement
- **December 15, 2022:** $6,400.00 - Office Rent Reimbursement (2 months)
- **Total reimbursed: $9,600.00**

**CORRESPONDING RENT PAYMENTS (from Wells Fargo checking):**
- **October 3, 2022:** Check #1001 - $3,210.00
- **November 4, 2022:** Check #4629 - $3,210.00
- **December 7, 2022:** Check #4632 - $3,257.17
- **Total paid: $9,677.17**

**NET TAX EFFECT:** Zero (payment/reimbursement nets out)

**CRITICAL ACTION REQUIRED:**
- ✅ **VERIFY:** These $9,600 reimbursements are NOT included in W-2 Box 1 (taxable wages)
- ✅ **DOCUMENT:** Provide rent checks + reimbursement paystubs to tax preparer
- ✅ **ACCOUNTABLE PLAN:** Ensure employer treated as accountable plan (not taxable compensation)

**Non-Reimbursed Expenses (Deductible):**
- Parking: $336.50 (NOT reimbursed - fully deductible)
- Rent overage: $77.17 (minor difference between payments and reimbursements)
- Internet: TBD (not reimbursed - need to locate payment records)

### Home Office & Mortgage Information
**Home Office Deduction (Dual Workspace Situation):**
- **2022 Work Location:** Split time between home office and Pasadena office
- **Home Office Qualification:** May still qualify if home is principal place of business OR used for administrative/management activities
- **Consideration:** Partial year or part-time home office use may reduce deduction percentage
- **Action Required:** Calculate actual percentage of time worked from home in 2022

**Mortgage Interest Deduction:**
- **Action Required:** Obtain Form 1098 (Mortgage Interest Statement) from lender for 2022
- **Deductible Amount:** All mortgage interest paid in 2022 (reported on Schedule A if itemizing)
- **Home Office Impact:** If claiming home office deduction using actual expense method, portion of mortgage interest already claimed in home office calculation
- **Note:** Cannot double-dip - mortgage interest is either:
  - Part of home office deduction (business expense on Schedule C), OR
  - Personal itemized deduction (Schedule A)
  - NOT both

**Home Depreciation/Amortization (If Using Actual Expense Method):**
- **Caution:** Claiming depreciation creates a depreciation recapture requirement when selling home
- **Alternative:** Consider simplified method ($5/sq ft) to avoid depreciation complications
- **If Claiming Depreciation:**
  - Calculate cost basis of home (purchase price + improvements)
  - Exclude land value (only building is depreciable)
  - Use 39-year straight-line depreciation for business portion
  - Must recapture depreciation on home sale (taxed at 25%)
- **Documentation Needed:**
  - Home purchase documents (closing statement)
  - Records of capital improvements
  - Home square footage measurement
  - Office square footage measurement
- **Accountant Discussion Required:** Weigh simplified method vs. actual expense method pros/cons

### Research Needed
- **Tesla Charger Installation (Early 2022):** Need to locate electrician installation payment. Charger was purchased in 2021, installation likely occurred in early 2022. Payment method unknown (not found in Wells Fargo Zelle/Venmo Jan-March 2022). Potential Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit (30% credit, up to $1,000 for residential EV charger installation). Need to find receipt/invoice to claim credit.
