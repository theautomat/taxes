## Questions for Accountant

1. **K-1 Distribution Discrepancy (Primary Issue):** The initial concern about the $46,633 difference between K-1 distributions ($164,567) and Wells Fargo wire transfers ($211,200) has now been confirmed. Chase bank records show exactly $211,200 in wire transfers to Kurt, matching Wells Fargo deposits perfectly. This means the discrepancy is between:
   - **Tax Return K-1 Line 16D:** $164,567 reported as distributions
   - **Actual Wire Transfers:** $211,200 sent from Chase and received by Wells Fargo
   - **Difference:** $46,633 MORE in actual cash distributed than reported on K-1

2. **November 2022 Timing Discrepancy:** Chase shows a $400 wire sent on 11/22/2022 (Trn: 3403642326Es) that may have posted to Wells Fargo in October or December due to processing timing. The monthly totals still reconcile perfectly ($211,200), but individual monthly counts differ by this one $400 transaction.

3. **Transaction Timing:** Some wires may show different dates between Chase (send date) and Wells Fargo (receipt date) due to processing time. This is normal for domestic wire transfers and explains minor monthly discrepancies.

4. **Wire Transfer Fees:** Each wire incurs a $25 fee on the Chase side (paid by Popstand) and a $15 receiving fee on the Wells Fargo side (paid by Kurt). Are these fees deductible business expenses for Popstand?
