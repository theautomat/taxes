## Important Tax Concepts

### S-Corporation Taxation Basics

1. **Pass-through income (K-1 Line 1):**
   - You pay tax on $190,886 whether you take distributions or not
   - This is your share of the company's profit
   - Taxed as ordinary income on your personal return

2. **Distributions (K-1 Line 16D):**
   - Generally NOT taxable income
   - Return of your basis in the company
   - Only taxable if they exceed your stock basis

3. **W-2 wages:**
   - Additional taxable income
   - Subject to FICA taxes (Social Security + Medicare)

### Your 2022 Tax Liability

**From Popstand:**
- W-2 wages: $30,000 (subject to income tax + FICA)
- K-1 income: $190,886 (subject to income tax only, no FICA)
- **Total taxable: $220,886**

The distributions ($164,567) are typically not taxable unless they exceed your basis.

## Questions for Further Investigation

1. **Basis calculation:** What was your stock basis at the beginning of 2022? This determines if any distributions are taxable.

2. **Wire transfer reconciliation:** Why do bank wire transfers ($211,200) differ from K-1 distributions ($164,567)?

3. **Business expenses:** Were the business expenses we've identified (software, office, etc.) already deducted on the 1120-S, or can they be claimed elsewhere?

4. **Self-employment tax:** As an S-Corp shareholder-employee, you should NOT pay SE tax on K-1 income (only on W-2 wages, which already had FICA withheld).
