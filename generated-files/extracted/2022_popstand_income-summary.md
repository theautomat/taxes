## 2. K-1 Shareholder Income (S-Corporation Pass-Through)

### Tax Document: Schedule K-1 (Form 1120-S)
**Source:** `2022-tax-return-documents-popstand-inc-client-copy-no-pass.pdf` (Pages 22-27)

**Kurt's Ownership:** 50% of Popstand Inc (50 shares of 100 outstanding)

**Co-Shareholder:** Christopher Whitman (50% ownership)

| Line | Description | Federal Amount | California Amount |
|------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Ordinary business income (loss) | $190,886 | $188,879 |
| 16D | Property distributions | $164,567 | $164,567 |

### Understanding K-1 Income

**Ordinary Business Income (Line 1): $190,886**
- This is Kurt's 50% share of Popstand's business profit
- This amount flows through to Kurt's personal tax return (Form 1040)
- Kurt pays personal income tax on this amount whether or not it was distributed
- This is NOT cash received - it's taxable income

**Property Distributions (Line 16D): $164,567**
- This is actual cash distributed to Kurt from the S-Corporation
- This represents a return of capital / profit distribution
- This is the cash that should appear in Wells Fargo bank statements

### Wells Fargo Wire Transfer Deposits (K-1 Distributions)

Kurt received 62 wire transfers from Popstand Inc via JPMorgan Chase:

**Monthly Summary:**

| Month | Number of Wires | Total Amount |
|-------|----------------|--------------|
| January 2022 | 10 | $27,000.00 |
| February 2022 | 5 | $16,000.00 |
| March 2022 | 7 | $26,500.00 |
| April 2022 | 5 | $16,000.00 |
| May 2022 | 2 | $9,000.00 |
| June 2022 | 6 | $27,500.00 |
| July 2022 | 5 | $18,500.00 |
| August 2022 | 5 | $17,000.00 |
| September 2022 | 4 | $16,000.00 |
| October 2022 | 6 | $15,500.00 |
| November 2022 | 3 | $10,800.00 |
| December 2022 | 4 | $11,000.00 |
| **TOTAL** | **62 wires** | **$211,200.00** |

**Typical wire description format:**
- `WT Fed#[number] Jpmorgan Chase Ban /Org=Popstand Inc`
- Each wire incurs a $15 service charge from Wells Fargo

### K-1 Distribution Reconciliation

| Source | Amount | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| K-1 Line 16D (Tax Return) | $164,567.00 | Distributions reported to IRS |
| Wells Fargo Wire Transfers | $211,200.00 | Actual cash received |
| **Difference** | **$46,633.00** | Bank deposits exceed K-1 |

**⚠️ DISCREPANCY:** Wells Fargo shows $46,633 MORE in wire transfers than the K-1 reports as distributions.

**Possible Explanations:**
1. Some 2022 wire transfers may have been recorded in 2021 K-1 or 2023 K-1 (timing differences)
2. Some wire transfers may represent loans or advances rather than distributions
3. The wire transfers may include amounts for both Kurt and Christopher that were later reallocated
4. Accounting timing differences between cash basis (bank) and accrual basis (tax return)

**Action Required:** Consult with accountant to reconcile the $46,633 discrepancy between:
- K-1 reported distributions: $164,567
- Bank wire transfers: $211,200

| Income Type | Amount | Tax Treatment |
|-------------|--------|---------------|
| W-2 Wages | $30,000.00 | Reported on Form 1040, already taxed via withholding |
| K-1 Ordinary Income (Line 1) | $190,886.00 | Flows to Form 1040, taxed at personal income tax rates |
| K-1 Distributions (Line 16D) | $164,567.00 | Return of capital, generally not taxable (reduces basis) |

## 5. Tax Implications for Kurt Braget

### What Kurt Must Report on His Personal Tax Return (Form 1040)

**W-2 Income:**
- $30,000 in wages from Popstand Inc
- Already has federal and state taxes withheld
- Report on Form 1040, Line 1

**Schedule K-1 Income:**
- $190,886 in ordinary business income (Line 1)
- This gets added to Kurt's personal income on Schedule E
- Kurt pays personal income tax rates on this amount
- This is IN ADDITION to the W-2 wages

**Total Popstand Income on Tax Return:** $220,886

### Tax Withholdings Already Paid

From W-2:
- Federal income tax withheld: $845.04
- Social Security tax withheld: $1,860.00
- Medicare tax withheld: $435.00
- CA SDI withheld: $330.00
- **Total W-2 withholdings:** $3,470.04

**⚠️ Important:** The $190,886 in K-1 income has NO withholding. Kurt will need to pay estimated taxes or owe taxes when filing unless he made quarterly estimated tax payments.

### Cash vs Taxable Income Analysis

| Category | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| Total Taxable Income (W-2 + K-1) | $220,886.00 |
| Cash Actually Received (net payroll + distributions per K-1) | $191,096.96 |
| **Phantom Income** | **$29,789.04** |

**Phantom Income:** Kurt owes taxes on $29,789.04 of income that he did not receive in cash (retained in company).

If Kurt is in the 35% combined federal + state tax bracket, this phantom income could result in approximately $10,426 in taxes owed on money he didn't receive.

## 6. Questions for Accountant

1. **K-1 vs Bank Reconciliation:** Why do Wells Fargo wire transfers ($211,200) exceed the K-1 reported distributions ($164,567) by $46,633? Are some wires recorded in different tax years?

2. **Phantom Income:** Kurt has $29,789 in taxable K-1 income that wasn't distributed. Does Kurt have sufficient basis to support future tax-free distributions of this retained income?

3. **Estimated Tax Payments:** Were quarterly estimated tax payments made on the $190,886 K-1 income? If not, what penalties might apply?

4. **State Tax (California):** K-1 shows different amounts for federal ($190,886) vs California ($188,879). What accounts for the $2,007 difference?

5. **Distribution Timing:** Are all 62 wire transfers in 2022 properly classified as 2022 distributions, or do some relate to prior or future tax years?

6. **Basis Calculation:** What is Kurt's current basis in Popstand Inc after accounting for:
   - $190,886 income addition
   - $164,567 distribution reduction
   - Any other basis adjustments
