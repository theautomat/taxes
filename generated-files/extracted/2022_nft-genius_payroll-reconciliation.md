## 6. Tax Implications

### What Kurt Must Report on 2022 Tax Return

**W-2 Income (Box 1 - Wages):**
- Expected: $274,999.98 (gross earnings)
- Already taxed via withholding: $101,689.42

**Reimbursements:**
- $58,554.94 in reimbursements should be NON-TAXABLE
- These should NOT appear on W-2 if properly documented as business expenses
- Verify with W-2 that reimbursements were excluded from taxable wages

### Tax Withholdings Already Paid
From paystub YTD totals:
- Federal + State + FICA taxes: $101,689.42 withheld
- This represents ~37% effective tax rate on gross wages
- Kurt may owe additional taxes or receive refund depending on:
  - Other income sources
  - Deductions and credits
  - Whether reimbursements were properly excluded from W-2

### 401(k) Contributions
- $9,000 contributed to 401(k) (pre-tax)
- This reduces taxable income by $9,000
- Expected W-2 Box 1 (taxable wages): ~$265,999.98 (gross minus 401k)

---

## 7. Questions for Accountant

1. **W-2 Verification:** Confirm that W-2 Box 1 shows $265,999.98 (gross minus 401k) and that the $58,554.94 in reimbursements were properly excluded as non-taxable.

2. **Reimbursement Documentation:** Are the reimbursements properly documented and substantiated? Especially the large $33,750 back-pay reimbursement from July?

3. **Office Rent Reimbursement:** Is the $9,600 in office rent reimbursements ($3,200/month Oct-Dec) properly supported by home office documentation and receipts?

4. **HRA (Health Reimbursement Arrangement):** Confirm the $13,750 in HRA reimbursements are properly structured and non-taxable. Are there receipts for qualified medical expenses?

5. **401(k) Verification:** Confirm 401(k) contributions of $9,000 are reflected on W-2 Box 12 with code "D".

6. **Estimated Tax Payments:** Were any quarterly estimated tax payments made beyond the payroll withholdings? If not, is there an underpayment penalty?

7. **State Tax:** Confirm California state income tax withholding is adequate given the high income and mid-year salary doubling.
