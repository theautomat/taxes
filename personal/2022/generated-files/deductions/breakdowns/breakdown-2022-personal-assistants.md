## Deductibility Analysis

### IRS Rules for Independent Contractor Payments

**General Rule (IRC §162):**
- Ordinary and necessary business expenses are deductible
- Payments to contractors for business services are generally deductible
- Must be reasonable in amount
- Must be for services actually rendered

**Key Requirements:**
1. ✅ **Trade or Business Expense** - Must be connected to your active trade or business
2. ✅ **Ordinary** - Common and accepted in your industry
3. ✅ **Necessary** - Helpful and appropriate for your business
4. ⚠️ **Reasonable** - Amount must be reasonable for services provided
5. ⚠️ **Actually Performed** - Services must have actually been rendered

### Specific to Personal Assistants

**Potentially Deductible If:**
- Assistant performed actual business-related tasks
- Tasks directly relate to business operations (not personal errands)
- Services were necessary for business efficiency
- Amount paid is reasonable for services rendered
- You can document the business purpose of services

**Examples of Deductible Business Assistant Tasks:**
- Scheduling business meetings and appointments
- Managing business correspondence and email
- Research for business projects
- Administrative support for business operations
- Coordinating with clients or vendors
- Managing business social media or marketing
- Bookkeeping or financial record organization
- Business travel arrangements

**Examples of NON-Deductible Personal Tasks:**
- Personal errands (dry cleaning, groceries, etc.)
- Personal appointment scheduling
- Household management
- Personal travel arrangements
- Family-related tasks

### Mixed Personal/Business Use

If assistant performed both business and personal tasks:
- **Must allocate** between business and personal
- Only business portion is deductible
- Need to document percentage of time on business vs. personal tasks
- Conservative approach: Only deduct clearly business-related time

**Tax Savings:** Varies by percentage

**Requirements:**
- Document percentage of business vs. personal tasks

## Comparison to Other Business Services

### Similar Deductible Services:
- **Virtual assistants** - Common for entrepreneurs
- **Administrative support** - Routine business expense
- **Bookkeepers** - Clearly deductible
- **Marketing assistants** - Business-related

### Key Difference:
Personal assistants have higher scrutiny because:

- "Personal" in the name triggers IRS attention
- Must clearly separate business from personal use

**Best Practice:** Document as "Business Assistant" or "Administrative Contractor" rather than "Personal Assistant"
