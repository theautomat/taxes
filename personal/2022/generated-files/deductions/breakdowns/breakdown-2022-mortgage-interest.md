## Mortgage Interest Rate Calculation

**From First Payment (February 22, 2022):**
- Principal Balance: $760,750.00
- Interest Charged: $2,060.36 (for 1 month)
- Monthly Rate: $2,060.36 ÷ $760,750.00 = 0.002708 = 0.2708%
- **Annual Rate: 0.2708% × 12 = 3.25%** ✓

**Formula for Monthly Interest:**
```
Monthly Interest = (Loan Balance × Annual Rate) ÷ 12
$2,060.36 = ($760,750.00 × 0.0325) ÷ 12
```

**Formula You Asked About:**
```
Annual Interest = Loan Balance × Interest Rate
$760,750.00 × 0.0325 = $24,724.38 (for full 12 months)
```

**Why actual interest ($20,410.43) is less:**
- Only 10 payments made in 2022 (not 12)
- Principal balance decreased each month
- Extra principal payments reduced balance faster

## Mortgage Interest Limitation (IRS $750,000 Cap)

### IRS Mortgage Debt Limits (Post-2017 TCJA)
- Loans originated **after December 15, 2017:** $750,000 limit ($375,000 if married filing separately)
- Loans originated **before December 16, 2017:** $1,000,000 limit (grandfathered debt)

**Your Loan:**
- **Origination Date:** January 8, 2022 (post-TCJA)
- **Applicable Limit:** $750,000 (not grandfathered)
- **Average Balance:** $752,317.87 (slightly exceeds limit)

### Limitation Calculation

**If mortgage exceeds the limit, use this formula:**
```
Deductible Interest = Total Interest Paid × (Debt Limit ÷ Average Mortgage Balance)
```

**Step 1: Calculate Average Mortgage Balance**
```
Average Balance = (Beginning Balance + Ending Balance) ÷ 2
Average Balance = ($760,750.00 + $743,885.73) ÷ 2 = $752,317.87
```

**Step 2: Calculate Limitation Ratio**
```
Limitation Ratio = $750,000 ÷ $752,317.87 = 0.9969 = 99.69%
```

**Step 3: Calculate Deductible Interest**
```
Deductible Interest = $20,410.43 × 0.9969 = $20,347.09
Non-deductible Interest = $20,410.43 - $20,347.09 = $63.34
```

**Result:**
- **Deductible mortgage interest (after limitation):** $20,347.09
- **Non-deductible interest:** $63.34 (only 0.31% of total - minimal)
