- Gas: $488.35
- Water: $230.00 (known, likely ~$920-1,200 for full year)

### Business Portion (15.2%):

## Missing Payment Analysis

### Why only 1 water payment found?

**Possible explanations:**
1. **Home purchased in January 2022** - prior payments under previous owner
2. **Quarterly billing** - Only 4 payments/year expected (Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct)
3. **Other payment methods** - User notes indicate calling to pay with credit card
4. **Two accounts** - User has 021509-000 AND 021509-001 (different properties?)

**Conservative approach:**
- Use only the $230 found for now
- Note that full year is likely $920-1,200 (4 quarters × $230-300)

### Why no Spectrum or Trash?

**Most likely:**
- Both paid via credit card (user notes confirm)
- Not in Wells Fargo checking account data
- Need to search credit card statements
