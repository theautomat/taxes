## Tax Treatment

### Deductibility

**IRS Rules:**
- Ordinary and necessary business expenses are fully deductible (IRC §162)
- Software subscriptions and SaaS services used for business are 100% deductible
- Must be directly related to your trade or business

**Your Situation:**
- You are a software developer working as both W-2 employee (NFT Genius) and S-Corp owner (Popstand)
- These services are clearly ordinary and necessary for software development business
- All charges paid through Privacy.com provide clear documentation trail

**Deduction Method:**
- **For Popstand S-Corp expenses:** Deduct on Schedule C or S-Corp return as business expenses
- **For W-2 work:** If these tools were required for NFT Genius work and not reimbursed, they may qualify as unreimbursed employee expenses
  - **However:** TCJA (2017) suspended unreimbursed employee expense deductions through 2025
  - **Recommendation:** Attribute all these expenses to Popstand S-Corp business

---

## Important Notes

### Multiple Revenue Sources
Since you have both W-2 income (NFT Genius) and S-Corp income (Popstand):

**Best approach:**
- Attribute services used primarily for Popstand work to Popstand S-Corp
- Services used for both can be split based on time allocation
- Services clearly for NFT Genius work (if not reimbursed) cannot be deducted due to TCJA suspension

**Conservative approach:**
- Claim all under Popstand S-Corp as legitimate business expenses
- Document that these tools are ordinary and necessary for software development business

### Blockchain/Web3 Services
QuickNode, Chainstack, and Pinata are clearly related to Web3/NFT development:
- Directly tied to your work at NFT Genius (blockchain company)
- Also used for Popstand projects
- Legitimate and ordinary expenses for Web3 developers

---

## Action Items

### For Tax Filing:

2. ⚠️ Download invoices from major services:
   - Heroku invoices (23 months)

   - QuickNode billing history
3. ⚠️ Review additional Privacy.com charges for more business services
4. ⚠️ Create expense schedule for tax preparer

### For Accountant Discussion:
