## Home Office Measurements

### Office Space
- **Dimensions:** 32 feet × 22 feet
- **Square Footage:** **704 sq ft**
- **Usage:** Dedicated home office for software development work
- **Exclusive Use:** Used exclusively for business
- **Regular Use:** Used regularly throughout 2022

### Total Home Size
- **Total:** 1,480 sq ft ([Source](https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/662-Mountain-View-St_Fillmore_CA_93015_M28779-58207))
- **Business Use Percentage:** **47.6%** (704 ÷ 1,480)

---

## Method 1: Simplified Method

**Calculation:** $5 per square foot, maximum 300 sq ft

**Home Office Deduction:**
- Office is 704 sq ft, but simplified method caps at 300 sq ft
- 300 sq ft × $5/sq ft = **$1,500**
- **Severely underutilizes 704 sq ft dedicated office space**

**Pros:**
- Simple, no detailed expense tracking needed
- No depreciation of home (avoids recapture on sale)
- Less audit risk
- Easy to calculate and document

**Cons:**
- Significantly lower deduction amount (only covers 43% of actual office space)
- Cannot also deduct actual home expenses
- Cannot deduct depreciation
- Wastes potential deduction from large dedicated office

**Tax Savings (45.3% combined marginal rate):**
- $1,500 × 45.3% = **~$679 tax savings**

## Method 2: Actual Expense Method

### Home Expenses Eligible for Deduction

Using actual business use percentage: **47.6%** (704 sq ft ÷ 1,480 sq ft)

#### Direct Expenses (100% deductible for office)
- Office repairs, painting, improvements: $[AMOUNT]
- Office furniture, fixtures: $[AMOUNT]

#### Indirect Expenses (47.6% Business Use)
These expenses benefit the entire home:

| Expense Category | Annual Amount | Business 47.6% |
|------------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Mortgage Interest** | $20,410.43 | **$9,715.36** |
| **Property Taxes** | $3,095.19 | **$1,473.30** |
| **Homeowners Insurance** | $[AMOUNT] | 47.6% |

| **Water/Trash** | $[AMOUNT] | 47.6% |

| **Depreciation** | $[AMOUNT] | 47.6% |

### Known Expenses Calculation

**Known Expenses (Mortgage + Property Tax only):**
- Mortgage Interest: $20,410.43 × 47.6% = **$9,715.36**
- Property Taxes: $3,095.19 × 47.6% = **$1,473.30**
- **Subtotal: $11,188.66**

**Tax Savings (45.3% combined rate):**
- $11,188.66 × 45.3% = **~$5,068 tax savings**

**With Utilities/Insurance (~$3,000/year estimate):**
- Additional deduction: $3,000 × 47.6% = $1,428
- Total deduction: ~$12,617
- **Tax savings: ~$5,715/year**

**Comparison to Simplified Method:**
- Actual method (known expenses): ~$5,068 savings
- Simplified method: ~$679 savings
- **Advantage: +$4,389 more savings**

## Depreciation Calculation (If Using Actual Method)

**[WARNING: Creates recapture obligation on home sale]**

### Step 1: Determine Depreciable Basis
- Home Purchase Price: $[AMOUNT NEEDED]
- Plus: Closing costs and capital improvements: $[AMOUNT]
- Less: Land value (not depreciable): $[AMOUNT]
- **Depreciable Basis (building only): $[AMOUNT]**

### Step 2: Calculate Annual Depreciation
- Residential rental property: 27.5 years straight-line
- Business use of home: 39 years straight-line
- Annual Depreciation = Depreciable Basis ÷ 39 years
- Business Portion = Annual Depreciation × Business %

### Example: $600,000 Home, 20% Land, 47.6% Business Use
- Purchase Price: $600,000
- Less Land (20%): $120,000
- Building Value: $480,000
- Annual Depreciation: $480,000 ÷ 39 = $12,307.69
- Business Portion: $12,307.69 × 47.6% = **$5,858.46/year**

**Tax Savings from Depreciation:**
- $5,858.46 × 45.3% = ~$2,654/year additional savings

**Recapture Cost When Selling:**
- Total depreciation taken over 10 years: $58,584.60
- Recapture tax (25% rate): $14,646.15
- Tax saved over 10 years: $26,540
- Net benefit: $26,540 saved - $14,646 recaptured = **$11,894 net gain**
