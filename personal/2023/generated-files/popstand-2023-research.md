### Preliminary Popstand Income from 2023 Wells Fargo Statements

Based on scanning the Wells Fargo statements (receiving side), Popstand activity in 2023 includes:

#### Wire Transfers from Popstand (via Chase to Wells Fargo)

| Month | Wire Count | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| January 2023 | 5 | $1,500 + $2,000 + $3,500 + $1,000 + $2,000 = ~$10,000 |
| February 2023 | 4 | $2,500 + $1,500 + $3,000 + $3,000 = ~$10,000 |
| March 2023 | 1 | $1,500 (estimated) |
| April-November 2023 | 0 | **No wire transfers** |
| December 2023 | 1 | Amount TBD |
| **Estimated Total** | **~11** | **~$22,000-25,000** (dramatic drop from $211,200 in 2022) |

#### Popstand Payroll Deposits (W-2 wages)

Payroll continued all 12 months in 2023:

| Month | Reference | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| January | Popstand Inc Payroll 230113 | Regular payroll |
| February | Popstand Inc Payroll 230215 | Regular payroll |

| November | **None visible** | No payroll deposit found |
| December | Popstand Inc Direct Dep (x2) | Two direct deposits (SD1700 and 231226) |

**Pattern Change:** Payroll appears to be monthly (mid-month) Jan-Oct, then shifts to "Direct Dep" format in December with 2 deposits. November has no visible Popstand payroll.

#### Zelle Payments TO Popstand (Outgoing from Kurt)

| Date | Description | Amount |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 2023-07-19 | Zelle to Popstand - Deposit Plus First | $2,000 (est) |
| 2023-07-21 | Zelle to Popstand - Pablo From Automatique | $2,000 (est) |

**Note:** These are contractor payments for Automatique Inc routed through Popstand. Total ~$10,000. These are Automatique business expenses, not Popstand income. Already documented in the Automatique research.

#### ACH Debits Referencing Popstand

| Month | Description | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| October | B2B ACH Debit - Lowes Brc Syf Paymnt, Account 798213105186101 Popstand Inc | Likely Lowe's business credit card payment via Popstand account |

## 3. Key Changes from 2022 to 2023

### Dramatic Drop in Wire Transfers
- **2022:** 62 wire transfers totaling $211,200 (Jan-Dec, steady flow)
- **2023:** ~11 wire transfers totaling ~$22,000-25,000 (Jan-Mar + Dec only)
- Wire transfers stopped almost completely after March 2023
- **Possible explanation:** Popstand business may have wound down or changed its distribution pattern

### Payroll Continued
- W-2 payroll deposits continued monthly through at least October 2023
- December had 2 "Direct Dep" entries instead of the usual Payroll format
- November appears to have no payroll deposit

### New: Automatique Connection
- Starting July 2023, Kurt sent Zelle payments TO Popstand (~$10,000 total)
- These were for contractor "Pablo" doing work for Automatique Inc (Kurt's new C-Corp)
- Popstand acted as an intermediary for these payments

## 4. What's Missing / Needed for 2023

### Critical Missing Documents

| Document | Priority | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **Popstand W-2 (2023)** | HIGH | Not found in repo. Needed for personal 1040. 2022 had W-2 showing $30,000 wages. |
| **Popstand K-1 (2023)** | HIGH | Not found in repo. Needed for personal 1040. 2022 had K-1 showing $190,886 ordinary income. |
| **Tax return password** | HIGH | 2023-popstand-tax-return.pdf is password-protected and cannot be read |
| **Payroll stubs** | MEDIUM | 2021 had monthly paystubs; 2022 had none saved separately; 2023 has none |

### Documents Present but Not Extracted

| Document | Status | Action Needed |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| Chase Bank Statements (12 months) | PDF only | Extract wire transfers and business activity |
| 2023 Popstand Tax Return | Password-protected | Need password to extract K-1, 1120-S data |
| Wells Fargo statements | Being processed | Popstand transactions identifiable but not isolated |

### Key Questions to Resolve

1. **W-2 wages:** What were Kurt's W-2 wages from Popstand in 2023? (2022 was $30,000)
2. **K-1 income:** What was Kurt's share of ordinary business income? (2022 was $190,886)
3. **Distributions:** What was the official K-1 Box 16D distribution amount?
4. **Business revenue:** How much did Popstand earn in 2023? (2022 was $2M+)
5. **Tax return password:** What is the password for 2023-popstand-tax-return.pdf?
6. **November payroll:** Was November payroll missed, or was it combined with December?
7. **Lowe's payments:** Are the B2B ACH debits through Popstand for business purposes?

## 5. S-Corp Reasonable Compensation Issue

### 2022 Situation
- Popstand paid Kurt $30,000 W-2 wages (officer compensation was $60,000 total for both shareholders)
- Kurt's total income from Popstand: $220,886 (W-2 + K-1)
- **Wire transfers** ($211,200) significantly exceeded K-1 distributions ($164,567)
- The IRS reasonable compensation doctrine requires S-Corp owners who provide services to receive "reasonable" W-2 wages
- $30,000 W-2 on $190,886 K-1 income (86% distributions vs 14% wages) could be challenged as unreasonably low

### Does This Apply to 2023?
- **Yes, likely still applies.** Payroll continued all year, indicating Kurt was still an employee
- If Popstand's business declined significantly (wire transfers dropped 90%), the reasonable compensation issue may be less severe
- The absolute amounts would be smaller, but the ratio of wages to distributions still matters
- Without the K-1 and W-2 data, we cannot assess the 2023 ratio

### Potential Risk
- IRS could reclassify distributions as wages, triggering FICA tax (15.3%)
- On the 2022 amounts, this could mean up to $30,000+ in additional payroll taxes
- For 2023, the risk is likely smaller given reduced distribution volume

## 6. Folder Structure Status

### Already Existed
- `personal/2023/source-documents/popstand/` - Has tax return PDF
- `personal/2023/source-documents/popstand-chase/` - Has 12 monthly statements

### Created
- `personal/2023/generated-files/extracted/popstand/` - Ready for extracted data

## 7. Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Get password for 2023 Popstand tax return** - This is the single most important missing piece
2. **Locate 2023 W-2 from Popstand** - Check Google Drive, email, or request from Chris Whitman/accountant
3. **Locate 2023 K-1 from Popstand** - Same as above

### Extraction Work
4. **Extract Chase bank statements** - Create wire transfer CSV similar to 2022 process
5. **Extract tax return data** - Once password obtained, create summary like 2022
6. **Cross-reference with Wells Fargo** - Verify Popstand income on receiving end

### Analysis
7. **Reconcile 2023 distributions** - Compare wire transfers to K-1 Box 16D
8. **Assess reasonable compensation** - Review W-2 vs K-1 ratio for 2023
9. **Check for missed deductions** - Same amendment opportunity as 2022?
10. **Clarify Lowe's ACH payments** - Determine if these are business expenses

## 8. Summary

Popstand's activity **decreased dramatically** in 2023 compared to 2022. Wire transfers to Kurt dropped from $211,200 (62 wires) to approximately $22,000-25,000 (~11 wires), with most transfers occurring in Jan-Mar 2023 and one in December. However, W-2 payroll continued monthly through most of the year, suggesting Kurt remained an employee.

The most critical gap is the **password-protected tax return** and the **missing W-2 and K-1 documents**. Without these, we cannot determine Kurt's taxable income from Popstand for 2023.

The S-Corp reasonable compensation issue from 2022 likely carries into 2023, though the smaller distribution amounts reduce the potential tax exposure.
