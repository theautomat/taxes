## 2. Payroll Provider Transition (January 2023)

The transition from Gusto to Paychex happened in mid-January 2023:

| Date | Description | Amount | Provider |
|------|-------------|--------|----------|
| Jan 13 | Gusto Pay 563596 230113 | $9,813.61 | Gusto (last regular paycheck) |
| Jan 17 | Gusto Pay 576921 230117 | $27,238.05 | Gusto (transition payment — likely final reimbursement batch) |
| Jan 31 | Nft Genius Inc Payroll | $10,781.38 | Paychex (first Paychex paycheck) |
| Feb 1 | Gusto Pay 883835 230201 | $1,250.00 | Gusto (final cleanup — likely HRA) |

**Notes:**
- The $27,238.05 on Jan 17 is unusually large and separate from regular payroll. In 2022, Gusto also processed large reimbursement batches. This likely represents accumulated reimbursements settled before the Gusto-to-Paychex cutover.
- The $1,250.00 on Feb 1 matches the exact monthly HRA amount from 2022 ($1,250/month), suggesting one final HRA payment through Gusto.

### W-2 Cross-Reference

| W-2 Field | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Box 1 (Wages) | $243,143.33 |
| Box 2 (Federal tax withheld) | $57,938.57 |
| Box 3 (SS wages) | $93,603.94 |
| Box 4 (SS tax) | $5,803.44 |
| Box 5 (Medicare wages) | $252,634.11 |
| Box 6 (Medicare tax) | $4,736.27 |
| Box 12-C (Group-term life) | $385.00 |
| Box 12-D (401k) | $9,490.78 |
| Box 12-DD (Health coverage) | $5,728.14 |
| Box 14 (CA SDI) | $779.11 |
| Box 16 (State wages) | $243,143.33 |
| **Box 17 (State income tax)** | **BLANK** |

### Known Withholdings (from W-2)

| Deduction | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Federal income tax | $57,938.57 |
| Social Security tax | $5,803.44 |
| Medicare tax | $4,736.27 |
| 401(k) contributions | $9,490.78 |
| CA SDI | $779.11 |
| **Total known deductions** | **$78,748.17** |

### Back-Calculated Unknowns

Using the formula verified in 2022 (Net deposits = Medicare wages - known deductions - state tax + reimbursements):

```
$215,323.24 = $252,634.11 - $78,748.17 - State Tax + Reimbursements
Reimbursements - State Tax = $41,437.30
```

If the Gusto transition payments ($28,488.05) are also reimbursements:
```
Total Reimbursements - State Tax = $41,437.30 + $28,488.05 = $69,925.35
```

| Scenario | State Tax | Reimbursements | Comparison to 2022 |
|----------|-----------|----------------|--------------------|
| State tax at 2022 rate (~$21,640) | $21,640 | $91,565 | Reimbursements 56% higher (seems high) |
| State tax at 2022 rate, Gusto payments NOT reimbursements | $21,640 | $63,077 | Reimbursements 8% higher (reasonable) |
| No state tax withheld, Gusto payments NOT reimbursements | $0 | $41,437 | Reimbursements 29% lower |
| No state tax withheld, Gusto payments ARE reimbursements | $0 | $69,925 | Reimbursements 19% higher |

**Most likely scenario:** The Gusto Jan 17 payment ($27,238.05) is a reimbursement batch, state tax was withheld at roughly the 2022 rate, and total reimbursements were ~$63k. This is consistent with 2022 patterns. See Section 5 for reasoning.

## 5. Deposit Pattern Analysis

### Three Distinct Pay Phases

**Phase 1: Jan-Mar ($10,670/paycheck baseline)**
- Feb 15 through Mar 31: four identical deposits of ~$10,670
- This appears to be the stable net pay with no variable reimbursements
- Compared to 2022 Q1 (~$5,204/paycheck net + no reimbursements), this is roughly double, consistent with the salary having been doubled in Aug 2022

**Phase 2: Apr-Jul (variable, $8,040-$21,454)**
- Large swings suggest variable reimbursements mixed into payroll
- Apr 28 ($21,453.60) and May 15 ($18,124.27) are the largest
- Pattern similar to 2022 when reimbursement batches caused deposit spikes

**Phase 3: Aug-Dec (sharp decline, $2,112-$5,228)**
- Aug 15 drops to $2,112.33 — a 80% drop from the Jan-Mar baseline
- Oct 31 through Nov 30 stabilizes at ~$5,228
- Dec drops again to ~$3,511
- This strongly suggests a salary reduction in August 2023

### Salary Change Evidence

The Aug 15 deposit of $2,112.33 is the sharpest discontinuity. Possible explanations:
1. **Salary cut** — most likely given the sustained lower deposits through year-end
2. **Increased deductions** — less likely to cause such a large drop unless a major new deduction was added
3. **Reduced hours** — possible if employment shifted to part-time

The stabilization at ~$5,228 in Oct-Nov suggests a new steady-state salary rate, followed by another small reduction in December (~$3,511).

## 6. Box 17 (State Tax) Investigation

### The Problem
Box 17 (CA state income tax withheld) is blank on the 2023 W-2. In 2022, $23,627.34 was withheld on $265,517.17 in wages.

### Evidence That State Tax Was Likely Withheld
1. **CA SDI was withheld** ($779.11 in Box 14) — CA tax setup was active
2. **Paychex is a major PEO** — failing to withhold CA income tax would be an extraordinary error
3. **Bank deposit math** is more consistent with state tax having been withheld (see Section 4)
4. **No unusually high deposits** — if state tax was not withheld, net pay would have been noticeably higher

### Action Items
- [ ] Call Paychex (1-800-741-6277) to confirm CA state tax withholding amount
- [ ] Request corrected W-2 (W-2c) if Box 17 was a reporting error
- [ ] Check CA FTB account for reported withholding
- [ ] Pull IRS Wage & Income Transcript for 2023

## 8. Outstanding Items (Pending Paystubs)

Once paystubs are obtained from Paychex, complete the following:

- [ ] Extract all 24 paystub details (gross, taxes, deductions, reimbursements, net)
- [ ] Match each paystub to its corresponding bank deposit
- [ ] Confirm CA state income tax withholding total
- [ ] Identify what caused the Aug 2023 pay decline (salary cut vs. deduction change)
- [ ] Categorize reimbursements (HRA, office rent, expenses, etc.)
- [ ] Identify what the Jan 17 Gusto $27,238.05 payment was for
- [ ] Verify 401(k) contribution total matches W-2 Box 12-D
- [ ] Full reconciliation: Net pay + Reimbursements = Bank deposits
