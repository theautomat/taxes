### Notable Observations from Bank Deposits

1. **Payroll provider transition:** Jan 13 deposit still labeled "Gusto Pay NFT Genius" but all subsequent deposits labeled "Nft Genius Inc Payroll" (Paychex)
2. **Declining pay pattern:** Deposits start at ~$10k/paycheck (Jan-Mar) and drop significantly by Aug-Dec ($2k-$5k range), suggesting either:
   - Salary reduction during the year
   - Increased pre-tax deductions (401k, benefits)
   - Reduced hours
3. **Large April 28 deposit ($21,453.60):** Unusually large - may include reimbursements or back pay
4. **Also received $1,250 Gusto Pay on Feb 1:** Labeled "Gusto Pay Kurt Braget" - likely a final HRA or reimbursement from the Gusto payroll system before the Paychex transition
5. **SS wages ($93,603.94) much lower than total wages ($243,143.33):** Indicates SS wage base was partially met at another employer or there was a mid-year SS cap hit

| Metric | 2022 | 2023 | Change |

| Federal tax withheld | $62,718.83 | $57,938.57 | -$4,780.26 |
| SS wages | $146,999.82 | $93,603.94 | -$53,395.88 |

| Address | 5724 Skyview Way, Agoura Hills | 662 Mountain View St, Fillmore | Moved |
| Group-term life (C) | N/A | $385.00 | New benefit |

### Key Changes 2022 to 2023
- **Wage decrease:** $22k less in wages, suggesting the salary was reduced or employment didn't span the full year at the same rate
- **Payroll provider switch:** From Gusto to Paychex PEO (Professional Employer Organization)
- **EIN change:** The EIN changed from 86-3619205 (NFT genius Inc direct) to 45-3164230 (Paychex PEO) - this is normal when switching to a PEO model
- **Address change:** Employee moved from Agoura Hills to Fillmore
- **401(k) increased:** Contributed $9,490.78 (up from $8,000 in 2022)
- **New group-term life insurance:** $385.00 in code C (taxable portion over $50k)
- **State income tax (Box 17):** Notably blank on the 2023 W-2 - this needs investigation
- **Medicare wages vs Box 1 gap:** $252,634.11 - $243,143.33 = $9,490.78 which exactly equals the 401(k) contributions, confirming proper treatment

## 4. What's Missing / Needed for 2023

### Documents We Have
- [x] W-2 (`personal/2023/source-documents/nft-genius/2023-w2-nft-genius.pdf`)

### Documents Missing / Needed
- [ ] **2023 Paystubs** - No paystub PDF found for 2023. In 2022, a 38-page PDF with all 24 Gusto paystubs was available. For 2023, need to obtain paystubs from Paychex (the new payroll provider). These would show:
  - Exact salary rate and any changes during the year
  - Breakdown of deductions (health insurance, dental, vision)
  - Reimbursements (HRA, office rent, business expenses)
  - When/why pay amounts changed significantly (the declining pattern)
- [ ] **State income tax verification** - Box 17 (state income tax) is blank on the W-2. Need to determine:
  - Was state income tax actually withheld? (The bank deposits suggest some withholding)
  - Is this a W-2 error that needs a W-2c correction?
  - Or was CA tax handled differently through the PEO arrangement?
- [ ] **Reimbursement documentation** - In 2022, $58,554.94 in reimbursements were paid through payroll (HRA, office rent, business expenses). Need to determine if similar reimbursements continued in 2023
- [ ] **401(k) statement** - Confirm $9,490.78 contribution and plan provider (changed from ForUsAll?)
- [ ] **Benefits enrollment documentation** - The new group-term life insurance ($385 in Box 12 code C) suggests expanded benefits package under Paychex PEO

### Questions to Resolve
1. **Why is Box 17 (state income tax) blank?** CA state income tax should have been withheld on $243k in wages. This could be a significant issue.
2. **What caused the pay decline throughout 2023?** Net pay dropped from ~$10k/paycheck to ~$3.5k/paycheck. Was there a salary reduction, increased deductions, or reduced hours?
3. **Did employment continue through December 2023?** The last deposit was Dec 29, 2023, suggesting yes.
4. **Were there reimbursements in 2023?** The variable deposit amounts (especially the $21k on Apr 28) suggest reimbursements may have been included.
5. **Was Popstand employment still active in 2023?** The SS wage cap was only partially hit ($93,603.94 vs $160,200 limit for 2023), which is unusual for someone earning $243k+ unless they had no other W-2 employer hitting SS.

## 5. Employment Continuity Assessment

**NFT Genius employment did continue into 2023 for the full year.** Evidence:
- W-2 was issued for tax year 2023
- Bank deposits show 24 payroll deposits from Jan 13 through Dec 29, 2023 (bi-monthly pattern)
- W-2 Box 1 shows $243,143.33 in total wages

**However, compensation was significantly reduced compared to 2022:**
- 2022 gross: $274,999.98 ($200k annualized rate Jan-Aug, $400k annualized rate Sep-Dec)
- 2023 W-2 Box 1: $243,143.33
- The declining deposit pattern suggests either a salary cut during 2023 or increased pre-tax deductions
